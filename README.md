# pseudo_labelling_workflow

Pseudo Labelling is a common machine learning method to quickly increase the size of training data. It functions as a wrapper algorithm over a base classifier, where a learning algorithm has access to a small set of labelled samples and a large set of unlabelled samples. It works by assigning labels to samples in the unlabelled set based on a model trained on a combination of the labelled samples and any previously pseudo-labelled samples. This process is repeated until the entire dataset has been assigned a label, and with each cycle the model is expected to improve due to larger training data.
