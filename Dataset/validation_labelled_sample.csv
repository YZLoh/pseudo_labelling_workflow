Below I am pasting an email from a historian, whom I asked about the correct title.| talk  

The truth is that the English language really has no equivalent to Freiherr (the title of the ruler) or Freiherrschaft (the title of the political entity), because neither or them existed in the English-speaking world.  The loose translations sometimes given (baron, barony) are inaccurate, in that they do not convey the concept of independent jurisdiction.  Medieval English barons were juridically much more subject to the kings than these (except for the few exceptions such as the liberty of the bishops of Durham and a few other historical exotica).
The concept wasn't limited to Silesia.  It existed throughout the Holy Roman Empire and within the hereditary domains of the Habsburgs, such as Bohemia after 1621.
It is normally preferable to keep the German term, italicized, and give a sentence or so of explanation.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

You are spot on Leladax. Some with a strong FYROM POV around here argue that 'Republic of Macedonia' is the only official name in use and wish to lock it in at Wikipedia.

While true many nations and NGO's have chosen in the interim to use """"Republic of Macedonia""""... all nations in principle agree to honour whatever name FYROM/Greece can hammer out. When it comes to Wikipedia itself all names should be used if NPOV was actually being observed... especially since the dispute is still ongoing.  Many countries around the world still officially use FYROM (including even the US which still uses both names at times (the US Senate resolution last year condemning FYROM actually used the FYROM name).

What I really think is missing from the article is that technically speaking FYROM is currently in breach of at least a few of its original UN brokered terms with Greece. (This incidentally is exactly why I the why the US government passed the resolution last year condemning FYROM for breaking terms,  why the Greek government vetoed FYROM's  recent attempt at NATO membership, , and why it will probably veto EU membership as well.)

Agreement Violation #1: FYROM was supposed to stick to FYROM for external use

FYROM citizens are now trying to be recognized exclusively as """"Republic of Macedonia"""" even though in Article 7 of the original UN brokered agreement (which their own leaders signed) specifically states

""""the Party of the First Part reserves the right to object to any membership referred to above if and to the extent of the Party of the Second Part is to be referred to in such organization or institution differently than in paragraph 2 of the United Nations Security Council resolution 817 (1993). (which is still be FYROM I believe)

Agreement Violation #2:: Refrain from propaganda against Greek cultural heritage and territory

Article 7 and 11 of the UN agreement between Greece and FYROM state:.

""""Each Party shall promptly take effective measures to prohibit hostile activities or propaganda by State-controlled agencies and to discourage acts by private entities likely to incite violence, hatred or hostility against each other.

If either Party believes one or more symbols constituting part of its historic or cultural patrimony is being used by the other Party, it shall bring such alleged use to the attention of the other Party, and the other Party shall take appropriate corrective action or indicate why it does not consider it necessary to do so.

The article should probably include a few real world examples to show the complaints are very real. I myself recently heard someone from FYROM claim Aristotle was actually Slavic on a forum but there are literally thousands of examples of irredentist behavior to be found. (a small subset of some recent examples that seemed relevant, verifiable and seemingly demonstrate the argument beyond the abstract) 

There exists a steady stream of FYROM supporters on the Alexander_the_Great article history page claiming Alexander wasn't Greek.  

Top ranked FYROM websites  almost universally are writing revisionist histories that suggest Alexander was not Greek  (quote taken from the website)
""""Contrary to modern Greek claims, Macedonia was never part of Greece, and the ancient Macedonians were not regarded as ancient Greeks.""""

Current FYROM Prime Minister welcomes Pakistan “Macedonian” Prince Ghazanfar  and uses it as """"proof"""" of their ancient Macedonian roots. That one really made me cringe considering not so long ago everyone was being assured by FYROM leadership...

'""""We are Slavs, who came to the region in the sixth century. We are not descendants of the ancient Macedonians.""""' Kiro Gligorov (FYROM's first President)

'""""We are not related to the northern Greeks who produced leaders like Philip and Alexander the Great. We are a Slav people and our language is closely related to Bulgarian... There is some confusion about the identity of the people of our country""""'. Gyordan Veselinov  (Canadian ambassador to Canada in interview to Ottawa Citizen in 1999)

(incidentally both quotes appear extremely relevant to the article. I tried to add them myself to the article but they were removed without justification. You are welcome to try.)

Whoever designed that link may not have known that the plan was  Ellicott's, rather than L'Enfant's. That also seems to be the case at Arlington Cemetery, where a historical marker in front of L'Enfant's grave illustrates Ellicott's Plan, rather than L'Enfant's original plan.  As L'Enfant objected to Ellicott's revisions in his letters, he would probably not be very happy about this misidentification. Fortunately, his grave is covered by a slab containing a copy of a portion of his own plan.  However, the public usually only sees the copy of Ellicott's plan (or revision). 

As to the caption of the pictures on the Wikipedia pages, the people who have commented above should all visit the website describing the Library of Congress' holdings of L'Enfant's and Ellicott's plans in the Library's catalog at http://lccn.loc.gov/95860578.

 SUKI (tm) and other stuff 

Whether or not you believe in SUKI (tm) is hardly the issue  a debate had evolved on the Talk: Suki page, and irregardless of the outcome, evidence was placed both for and against the existence of SUKI (tm) as a major world religion.  I personally am neutral on SUKI (tm)  I have heard of it in my travels to Japan and on the west coast of North America, have good reason to believe its a religion, but not being versed in Japanese culture, I cannot be entirely sure.

Someone had gone into that page and injected the phrase, """"SUKI (tm) is fake"""", without signing the comment, and without appending the comment in an appropriate place.  I reverted such edit on the basis that it was innappropriately added, and not on the basis of content.  If the person who believes (through his/her comment) that 'SUKI (tm) is fake', then such person should offer some evidence constructed in a fashion that is at least consistent with other comments on the page, appended to the end of the discussion.

It was on an amendment to the Bill, not the Bill itself (the amendment would have required the prosecution to prove that a statement was intended to incite terrorism, rather than that it might have that effect, in order to secure a conviction). The original result announced was Ayes 299, Noes 300. Had Galloway attended he would have voted Aye and the result would have been declared a tie at 300, but the Speaker would have given his casting vote to the Noes in line with precedent that a tie on an amendment is broken in the direction of the Bill as originally introduced. (It subsequently turned out that the tellers had counted one extra MP as voting Aye and the result was actually 298 to 300, but that is not particularly relevant)

The point for the mention is not that Galloway's absence actually deprived the opposition of the chance to defeat the government, but that following the vote, many people said that it did. Given the high profile which Galloway gave to this aspect of politics, it was not surprising that his absence was particularly noteworthy.  | Talk",0,0,0,0,0,0

Good day to you, sir. It seems a shame that you have taken this attitude, after all, I did welcome you nicely in the hope that you might want to contribute constructively to this encyclopedia. Wikipedia isn't a spoof website, it's an encyclopedia, so articles that you think are amusing are not nessesarily seen as funny by others. It wasn't actually me that deleted it, I merely flagged it up as being non-encyclopedic and another editor thought the same. Westenders is a nice idea for a parody soap opera, and that sort of thing might be seen as quite comical on a website such as Uncyclopedia, which is as spoof encyclopedia, thus if you want to write less serious entries that may be the place to go. However, if you do wish to contribute seriously, please don't let this setback stop you - perhaps our paths will cross again in a positive context.

More weasel or pov wording. The paragraph beginning """"ICMEC found in its initial report that only 27 countries had legislation needed to deal with child pornography offenses"""". This entire paragraph is just a series of claims made by ICMEC, not even a claim made by or supported by a neutral third party, so it should be worded to reflect that. We have more weasel in """"ICMEC has worked with legislatures in 100 countries to adopt new laws combating child pornography"""". We have sources given for this. The first is invalid, being a press release from ICMEC. the second, Rhona Schuz (2014). The Hague Child Abduction Convention: A Critical Analysis. A&C; Black. pp. 82–83, makes no mention of at all of child pornography, but talks about a conference on child custody problems in which the ICMEC took part, and which, according to the source resulted in """"little to solve the problems"""". The third source is a strategic plan by the Hague Conference on Private International Law which again does not mention child pornography once. 
The last source talks about ICMEC being involved in training law enforcement officers in Thailand about child exploitation issues. This is not """"working with legislatures to adopt new laws"""".

 Problems with """"Netbooks in education section"""" 

I feel like there are a couple of problems with the Netbooks in education section:

1) It doesn't seem to be written from a NPOV, and the tone is even a little advertisement-like. """"Netbooks have the potential to change the way students and teachers interact"""", """"The benefits of integrating netbooks in the classroom are many, but they are maximized when there is a 1-1 student to computer ratio"""", etc.

2) It's too long. I don't see any reason why this section should take up 1/4 of an already very long article. The """"activities"""" subsection is pure fluff. The sections on """"Effects on student learning"""", """"Costs and logistics"""", and """"Training and staff development"""", are basically fine, but they convey no information that's specific to netbooks. The information belongs in an article like E-learning.

My suggestion would be to keep the first two paragraphs of the section and chuck everything else (which is what I'll do in a day or two if there aren't any objections).   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

It is generally considered acceptable to remove personal attacks, though there are some who disagree with that. If when you remove a personal attack you are reverted, then do not remove it again. Instead seek an outside party to investigate, preferably on some sort of public noticeboard.

No, there are not different standards for different editors. There is however a gap between the treatment of those who know how to work with the system, and those who do not grasp the intricate details. While Wikipedia claims not to be a bureaucracy does in fact share many similar traits with a bureaucracy. Knowing the correct """"form"""", noticeboard or procedure will take you far, knowing the tone and content expected from said processes and presenting in that fashion will take you even farther.

re German Pigeon Club Links
G'day Mate, I guess what I'm trying to say by wanting them footnoted is that """"External links should not normally be used in the body of an article"""" as per that style guideline. Quite frankly it looks bad in an article when they are done like that. In my opinion I think it's better to select/adapt info from the website and link (footnote) to it in the reference section. Otherwise just add the links to the external link section. Actually that would probably be best for the German club main page link to just be added to external links. No need to have two active links in that particular paragraph. It does look terrible per WP:MOS it suggest  looks better. I'd be inclined to use (in German) however. So no ones doubting the veracity or anything like that mate -) Just trying to clean things up is all. So I'm suggesting now we just add the first link (VDT-online main page) to the external links section (delink the text in article) and footnote the second link to a reference section or otherwise use (in German) at the end of the sentence rather than linking the text. In my opinion that would look a whole lot better and fits the Wikipedia guidelines better.  Buzz Me... """,0,0,0,0,0,0

preventative measures:
dependant upon control and elimination of the insect vector .
There is currently no artificial means of prevention.
Methods used to prevent the spread of disease, or to protect individuals in areas where malaria is endemic, include prophylactic drugs, mosquito eradication, and the prevention of mosquito bites. There is currently no vaccine that will prevent malaria, but this is an active field of research.

Some drugs that can be used for treatment of malaria can also be used for its preventative qualities however they need to be taken daily or weekly. These are seldom used by those living in a malaria abundant enivornment and are commonyl found amongst travellers visitng regions of hight malaria activity.
Quinine was used starting in the seventeenth century as a prophylactic against malaria. The development of more effective alternatives such as quinacrine, chloroquine, and primaquine in the twentieth century reduced the reliance on quinine. Today, quinine is still used to treat chloroquine resistant Plasmodium falciparum, as well as severe and cerebral stages of malaria, but is not generally for malaria prophylaxis.

Modern drugs used preventively include mefloquine (Lariam®), doxycycline (available generically), and atovaquone proguanil hydrochloride (Malarone®). The choice of which drug to use is usually driven by what drugs the parasites in the area are resistant to, as well as side-effects and other considerations. The prophylactic effect does not begin immediately upon starting taking the drugs, so people temporarily visiting malaria-endemic areas usually begin taking the drugs one to two weeks before arriving and must continue taking them for 4 weeks after leaving (atovaquone proguanil only needs be started 2 days prior and continued for 7 days afterwards).

Controlling the vector is the most useful way of preventing the spread of malaria.
Efforts to eradicate malaria by eliminating mosquitoes have been successful in some areas. Malaria was once common in the United States and southern Europe, but the draining of wetland breeding grounds and better sanitation, in conjunction with the monitoring and treatment of infected humans, eliminated it from affluent regions. In 2002, there were 1,059 cases of malaria reported in the US, including eight deaths. In five of those cases, the disease was contracted in the United States. Malaria was eliminated from the northern parts of the USA in the early twentieth century, and the use of the pesticide DDT eliminated it from the South by 1951. In the 1950s and 1960s, there was a major public health effort to eradicate malaria worldwide by selectively targeting mosquitoes in areas where malaria was rampant.[12] However, these efforts have so far failed to eradicate malaria in many parts of the developing world - the problem is most prevalent in Africa. The United States itself may face the spread of malaria in the future as climate change (warming) leads to an expansion of the areas in which mosquitoes are active..

Mosquito nets and prevention of mosquito bites

Mosquito nets help keep mosquitoes away from people, and thus greatly reduce the infection and transmission of malaria. The nets are not a perfect barrier, so they are often treated with an insecticide designed to kill the mosquito before it has time to search for a way past the net. Insecticide-treated nets (ITN) are estimated to be twice as effective as untreated nets.[16] Since the Anopheles mosquitoes feed at night, the preferred method is to hang a large """"bed net"""" above the center of a bed such that it drapes down and covers the bed completely.

The distribution of mosquito nets impregnated with insecticide (often permethrin) has been shown to be an extremely effective method of malaria prevention, and it is also one of the most cost-effective methods of prevention. These nets can often be obtained for around US$2.50 - $3.50 (2-3 euros) from the United Nations, the World Health Organization, and others.

For maximum effectiveness, the nets should be re-impregnated with insecticide every six months. This process poses a significant logistical problem in rural areas. A new type of impregnated net, called Olyset, releases insecticide for approximately 5 years[17], and costs about US$5.50. ITN's have the advantage of protecting people sleeping under the net and simultaneously killing mosquitoes that contact the net. This has the effect of killing the most dangerous mosquitoes. Some protection is also provided to others, including people sleeping in the same room but not under the net.

Unfortunately, the cost of treating malaria is high relative to income, and the illness results in lost wages. C",0,0,0,0,0,0

I'm not sure the etymology of the word has much to do with it; the idea of religious police is pretty common on one level or another in almost all Islamic countries.

Take its incarnation in Saudi Arabia and compare it to the village enforcement groups found in northern Pakistani villages, for instance. Or the versions in Egypt and Yemen, which have (at least at this point) more to do about making sure that the only version of Islam practiced is the state-sponsored one.

Dear Woohookitty,

My name is Jonathan Obar user:Jaobar, I'm a professor in the College of Communication Arts and Sciences at Michigan State University and a Teaching Fellow with the Wikimedia Foundation's Education Program. This semester I've been running a little experiment at MSU, a class where we teach students about becoming Wikipedia administrators. Not a lot is known about your community,  and our students (who are fascinated by wiki-culture by the way!) want to learn how you do what you do, and why you do it. A while back I proposed this idea (the class) to the community HERE, where it was met mainly with positive feedback. Anyhow, I'd like my students to speak with a few administrators to get a sense of admin experiences, training, motivations, likes, dislikes, etc. We were wondering if you'd be interested in speaking with one of our students.

So a few things about the interviews:
 Interviews will last between 15 and 30 minutes.
 Interviews can be conducted over skype (preferred), IRC or email. (You choose the form of communication based upon your comfort level, time, etc.)
 All interviews will be completely anonymous, meaning that you (real name and/or pseudonym) will never be identified in any of our materials, unless you give the interviewer permission to do so.
 All interviews will be completely voluntary. You are under no obligation to say yes to an interview, and can say no and stop or leave the interview at any time.
 The entire interview process is being overseen by MSU's institutional review board (ethics review). This means that all questions have been approved by the university and all students have been trained how to conduct interviews ethically and properly.

Bottom line is that we really need your help, and would really appreciate the opportunity to speak with you. If interested, please send me an email at obar@msu.edu (to maintain anonymity) and I will add your name to my offline contact list. If you feel comfortable doing so, you can post your name  instead.

If you have questions or concerns at any time, feel free to email me at obar@msu.edu. I will be more than happy to speak with you.

Thanks in advance for your help. We have a lot to learn from you.

Sincerely,

Jonathan Obar

 You should wait for others to write an article about subjects in which you are personally involved. This applies to articles about you, your achievements, your band, your business, your publications, your website, your relatives, and any other possible conflict of interest. 

Creating an article about yourself is strongly discouraged. If you create such an article, it might be listed on articles for deletion. Deletion is not certain, but many feel strongly that you should not start articles about yourself.

If you are not """"notable"""" under Wikipedia guidelines, creating an article about yourself may violate the policy that Wikipedia is not a personal webspace provider and would thus qualify for speedy deletion.

af871a0336c6f865,"Complex Iteration 

I've discovered that not only fractional iteration is possible, but also complex iteration. It's not as intuitive as fractional iteration, but it does make sense once you have a new model for what iteration means. Probably the simplest explanation is with orbitals in the complex plain: iterating to a real values generates the complex orbitals as paths. Iterating to imaginary powers, meanwhile, generates paths perpendicular to the orbitals at every point. You need the entire vector field of orbitals to know the new path. For example, iterating a linear function (multiplying by a constant) creates orbitals which are rays. Iterating to imaginary powers creates paths with are concentric circles. After that, complex iteration can be done by composing real and imaginary values. For a more precise derivation, I had to invent a new type of derivative, it looks at the instantaneous change in value at a point as the function iterates. The formula for this derivative is: 
f*(x) = lim n->0 (fn(x) - x)/n
Which is equivalent to the derivative of f's Abel function. The key about this derivative is it has the property that fn* = f x n . This enables iteration to imaginary powers to be calculated directly. Ultimately I think it is equivalent to taking the analytic extension of the Abel function, but it's a bit more intuitive than Taylor series witchcraft. I've done the calculations to arrive at Euler's identity using this method rather than the typical one, and graphically it makes much more sense: once it's understood how complex iteration works, it's just geometry to find the imaginary value e must be raised to in order to complete the arc from 1 to -1.",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Possible narrowing of US racial gap

Gains have been fairly uniform across the entire range of black cognitive ability.[28] J. Philippe Rushton and Arthur R. Jensen have disputed Dickens's and Flynn's findings, calculating a mean gain for Blacks of zero to 3.44 IQ points, and questioned the exclusion of four independent tests that showed low or negative IQ gains.[33] However, in the very same 2006 study that was criticized by Rushton and Jensen, Flynn and Dickens give explicit reasons for why four tests were excluded.

1. This is certainly not the final word on this. There are lot of things more that can be said about this.
2. This subject is already discussed here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_intelligence#Score_convergence
3 If the US scores are converging then this may or may not be related to what causes the Flynn effect in other nations.
As such I see no need for a duplicate discussion of the subject in this article. the material should instead be replaced with a brief mention of the controversy together with the link above to the race and intelligence article where possible US score convergence is properly discussed.

94a6999d309e2fa3,"""::::That's an interpretation. And state and nation are inseparable under the Spanish constitution (1978) that only accepts the term nation for Spain. 
Wanting to keep Spain united is legitimate but, specially as this is done via denying the right of self-determination for minority nations such as the Basque one, it clearly is Spanish nationalism.
Part of the problem may be that """"nationalist"""" in Spanish has not the negative connotation that may have in English. Instead """"patriotic"""" does have a negative connotation in Spanish that doesn't seem to have in English. They are sort of inverted in their shades. But basically they mean the same thing after all. 
Nationalism is after all the ideology that supports the ambitions of certain nation (nation-state, stateless nation...), often at the expense of others. It's not very different from patriotism actually but somehow people seem to feel differently about these terms and the feelings are opposed in English and Spanish. In Spanish """"patria"""" (fatherland), """"patriota"""" and """"patriótico"""" are part of the language of the Army, which is inherently associated to Francoism and other many military coups. Franco and his partisans abused these terms mercilessly, so Basque nationalists almost never call themselves """"patriotas"""" in Spanish, even if that's the literal translation of """"abertzale"""" but """"nationalists"""". On the other hand Spanish nationalists (PP, PSOE, some minor parties) don't use either term normally but talk about the unity of Spain and not being nationalist (in the sense of stateless nations' patriots). 
Also, back to the PSOE, they have a somewhat confuse discourse but, outside of Catalonia, they are clearly centralists. Navarrese PSN is as anti-Basque as UPN (PP). Western Basque PSE-EE is, despite its incorporation of the acronym EE, at most very limitedly regionalist. 
Under PSOE governments transference of attributions as per the Gernika statute were frozen almost totally most of the time. Their discourse may be somewhat confuse but they are clearly against Basque self-determination and self-rule beyond what is almost unavoidable to keep some appearence of social peace. They are not as extremist or inflexible as PP maybe but that only makes them moderate Spanish nationalists, but Spanish nationalists anyhow. 
PSOE is also strongly in the Jacobinist tradition that all pan-French parties have. Yet the reality of Spain doesn't fit so well with those centralist premises and therefore an unstable arrangement had to be made. It was nevertheless more impelled by the extinct UCD of Suárez than by the PSOE itself. And it's understood by most that the coup of 1981 was a whistle blow, with the complicity of PSOE, against """"excessive"""" decentralization that Suárez seemed willing to concede. 
Whatever the case, the term """"unionist"""" seems to avoid all this problematic and is a good English term. I really can't find anything better. My POV is """"Spanish nationalist"""" as more precise term, """"unionist"""" is for me a linguistic compromise and also a step towards NPOV. 
I'd really like to hear from Mountolive. He's not said a single word.

 The official language box can only have Malay because Malay is the only official language. Unlike India, South Africa, or Canada or Singapore of which their constitutions say there are more than one official language, Malaysian constitution explicitly says only Malay is the official language. Thus - only Malay in the official language box. Wikipedia's job is to spread information, not make new information. See WP:NOR.

 2) I accept that this point is correct, however, the article mentions that """"Creationist beliefs may be based on creationist theology, creation science, or a combination of both"""" therefore making this criticism completely relevant to the article. Equally, the further criticism of 'creation science' could be applied more widely to creationism as a whole. I am referring here to the sentence, """"Science uses the scientific method to systematically comprehend reality as it is, whereas 'creation science' begins with an assumption and attempts to find evidence or twist facts to support this original assumption.""""
3 )It is more a critical approach towards creationism, rather than simply 'creation science' that I am advocating. This article is misleading in that it appears to add totally equal merit to both creationism and evolution. While this may appear to be in the interests of NPOV, the reality is that the actual evidence for evolution is so hugely overwhelming, that to give an impression of equal validity is itself a bias point. Sorry, but the evidence for evolution is overwhelming, creationism is a pseudo-science of no real merit, and this should be quite clear in the article. I accept that an argument putting forward the 'credentials' of creationism is fair and should be included, but the argument against it should not be tamed in to give the ostensible appearance of neutrality.  17:38, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)""",0,0,0,0,0,0

I suppose it’s just possible that it does, and will show up as a new episode at some time, but the makers don’t usually provide any early announcement of new episodes: you just have to watch out for them in the guides to forthcoming programs!

I’ve added a grid for the forthcoming “Santa’s Grotto” DVD (release date 25 October 2010 according to all the main sellers of such items), allowing 10 lines for the episode list as the cover shown says “Features 10 fun packed piggy tales”. Also, following what seems to be usual practice, I’ve assumed that the first episode on the DVD will be titled “Santa’s Grotto”, though we don’t know yet when it will be first be shown on TV. We can fill the rest in when we know exactly what episodes are to be included, and their order. Presumably any new episodes being included on the DVD will be first broadcast prior to the DVD release date?

But they all were telling lies
 15) If anyone trusts you on your oaths of Quran that person is bound to be doomed in the end.
 16)If anyone comes under the shadow of Huma bird, no one can lay its hands on it-not even a brave cow.
 17)If a man sits behind the back of a lion neither anyone can catch him nor a goat or a sheep or a deer can even pass nearby.
 (Aurangzeb ! I stand in shadow of the Almighty and your men who are like goats,sheep and deer could not harm me inspite of your deceptions.)
 18)If I had deceived by taking oath on Holy Quran like the way you have done, I would not have bought my dear fighters to this position of disadvantage (by bringing them out of Anandgarh fort).
 IN VERSES FROM 19 TO 41 BELOW, GURU SAHIB GAVE AN ACCOUNT OF THE BATTLE OF CHAMKAUR FOUGHT ON 22ND DECEMBER,1704 AND THE REASONS THAT FORCED HIM TO TAKE UP THE SWORD AGAINST THE MUGHALS AND HILLY RAJPUT KINGS

 20)That the promise breakers launched a surprise attack with their swords, arrows and guns.
 21)It was out of sheer helplessness that I came in the battle field.(Having thus decided) I came with all the battle plans and munitions.
 22)When all stratagem employed for (solving) a problem are exhausted, only then taking your hand to the sword is legitimate.
 (This is the most quoted of Zafarnamah.300 years ago, Guru Gobind singh ji had laid down the circumstances when a person or a nation can pick up the sword against the other)
 23)What trust can I have on your oath on Quran ? Otherwise you tell why should I have taken path of taking up the sword.
 24)I do not know that this person (Aurangzeb) is cunning like a fox.Otherwise I would never have come to this place that is Chamkaur (by vacating Anandgarh on the false oaths of Aurangzeb and his men).

The user's final edit was to blank his Talk page with the edit summary """"fuck it.""""  The page blanking was reverted """"because of an active block"""".  The block is no longer active, the user has not returned to Wikipedia, and I think it is pretty clear that """"fuck it"""" is the equivalent of """"I am retiring from Wikipedia.""""  It seems to me that if someone has expressed quite clearly that they don't want to come back to Wikipedia and that they don't want their sad saga displayed on their Talk page for all eternity, that is within their rights.
Also, I question whether the initial reversion of the page blanking was even according to policy.  Show me one policy that says you cannot blank active block messages on your talk page, hmmm?  While WP:DRC is merely a guideline, there is a distinct lack of Wikipedia policy limiting what kind of content users can remove from their Talk page.  I happen to think there should be policy limiting what a person is allowed to remove from their own talk page (e.g. warnings <24 hours old and active block notices) but as it currently stands there is no such policy, at least not that I can find.  (If I am wrong, please enlighten me!)
If I have to abide by rules I think are dumb, then so does everybody else.  In fact, that is the difference between us and Karaku  Karaku disagreed with the rules so he chose to aggressively break them and call everyone else ignorant.  I disagree with the rules, but I realize they have been formed by community consensus and so I will abide by them as long as they are in place.  And by my interpretation of the current rules, Karaku's blanking of the Talk page should never have been reverted.  
Furthermore, while I recognize that I was using the word """"VANISH"""" imprecisely, it appears to be a longstanding tradition in Wikipedia that if a user wants to just leave and clear out the ugly history of their wrongdoing, they have the right to do that.  Karaku very clearly indicated a desire to do just that (is there really that much difference between putting a banner saying """"Retired"""" at the top of your Talk page vs. blanking the thing with the edit summary """"fuck it""""?).
Anyway, I'm obviously not going to get in an edit war over a retired user's talk page.  I'm just sort of surprised at the insistence to leave all this stuff in place when the user doesn't want it and Wikipedia policy provides no mechanism to override those wishes...   """,0,0,1,0,0,0

Fair use rationale for Image:Bassinthegrass.gif

Thanks for uploading or contributing to Image:Bassinthegrass.gif. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. Suggestions on how to do so can be found  here.

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. Using one of the templates at Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to ensure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template.  Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page. 

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the """"my contributions"""" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting """"Image"""" from the dropdown box. Note that any non-free media lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on criteria for speedy deletion.

I'm not talking about belief of majority. In fact I would presume a billion Muslims specifically state he did not claim to be God and many of other faiths would agree.

Considering the historical effect in least the concept he claimed to be god I think may make it relevant here, but I could see taking it off as disputed.

The mention of the board of directors of the Nobel Prize was just meant to support this. Your problem is you are always confused about what is being discussed.

Hi HaeB, the post linked to in the News section of the draft of the next Signpost seems to be less certain of the 14 June start than the Signpost report is. 

I had a look at the Help page linked to as well, which is going to get a lot of traffic after publication. It is very confusing, a matter I've taken up on the Help talk page.

It's very concerning.  (talk) 
Hi Tony, I am glad someone is doing fact-checking ;) Seeing your subsequent edits on the story , it seems that your concerns about the date have already been resolved. I think that  June 14 was spelled out quite clearly in the linked announcement, and from the current discussion at the RfC it seems that at least at the moment, they are intending to stick to it.

@Jytdog:  I agree with  that your personal views about how regulation works and how well it works is not relevant at all here, and it is a distraction.  Additionally, your definitions of """"mainstream"""" do not comport with Wikipedia.  Wikipedia defines Mainstream as follows:
Mainstream refers to a current of thought that is presently widespread.  It includes all popular culture and media culture, typically disseminated by mass media.
The mainstream popular majority view is that GMO's are not safe and should be labelled, and with your familiarity with the Genetically modified food controversies article, I'm sure you are well aware of that.  But I'll provide RS anyway.  For example:  [this].  Also, 93% of Americans think GMO's should be labelled according to this New York Times survey.  So the """"mainstream"""" view of GMO's, GMO safety and labeling and adequacy of regulation does not comport with your views of what """"mainstream"""" means.
We all know that Wikipedia is not going to report the mainstream view as if it were a fact, because the public can be wrong and so can the media.  So Wikipedia relies instead on the """"mainstream scholarship"""" WP:VALID or """"mainstream scientists"""" WP:PSCI as experts, not the public and not the views of civil servant regulators, farmers, firefighters or lawyers who are """"in the trenches"""".  This bizarre tangent saying that low level regulators are mainstream """"experts"""" is not helpful to improving the article, because it has nothing to with WP:RS and WP:PAG.
Please let us focus on correcting the """"scientific consensus"""" statement that was not sustained by your RfC and in this section addressing 's proposed statement.  Please provide solid RS to back up your objections and assertions, rather than giving personal opinions and expecting us to trust your views are solidly based on RS, especially when RS is provided that says otherwise.  These tangents are distracting and in my opinion wasting our time, which has the effect of keeping the status quo defective sentence in place.  You have agreed that the sentence needs revision, and you have been asked a number of times to provide an alternative sentence, which you think would gain consensus, and I have yet to see it.  What I see is opposition and distraction to attempts to improve the problematic sentence.  Please let us stay focused on improving the article  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Still concerned about balance 

I've put in a fair bit of time on the article, both in verifying/cleaning content and filling in material, enough that I think I can say I have gone over things in detail.

Look, for example, at Korea and the Caribbean/Cuba/Cuban missile crisis; those are a start on what I think is encyclopedic coverage. Just to say, with no other background, that the CIA trained police or set up an Operation Gladio network really doesn't give information; I'd recommend waiting for more background and context.

There are news reports from reputable journalists, but there are also quite a number from activists for varying positions. I'm afraid I don't give equal credit to a staff writer for the Washington Post and for the Revolutionary Worker.

The article is impossibly long, yet its covert operations section is full of fragments. It's going to have to break up so those fragmentary sections can be edited; it's taking a long time to save the file now.  Note that I was able to put estimative/analytic material in for Korea and Cuba. Much data of that sort is available, often in the form of the actual declassified documents. Not to put in relevant reports, National Intelligence Estimates, etc., gives the impression that the agency is purely covert operations, since the reports were almost never mentioned for countries I sawjust controversial """"dirty tricks"""". That's not NPOV.

Many sources are available for the report literature, including the George Washington University National Security Archives, the Avalon Project at Yale, the archives at Mount Holyoke, the military staff colleges and research institutes, the Foreign Relations of the United States series, and even the CIA FOIA Reading Room. There is, for example, a huge amount of reporting about Southeast Asia, including strong disagreements among the CIA, military, Office of the Secretary of Defense, and White House (Sam Adams' book, War of Numbers is excellent, but also see the Pentagon Papers).

I'd like to suggest that people editing this look at some of my articles on the process of intelligence, which may help understand things that aren't just covert destabilization. Start with Intelligence cycle management, which will take you through a hierarchy of articles. The HUMINT sections do deal with clandestine rather than covert activity; I'm actively working on them. The article on Clandestine HUMINT and Covert Action is particularly relevant both in history, and balance between clandestine and covert activities. Especially in WWII, there was often a conflict between operations and intelligence gathering. 

Please let me help, but understand that my reaction is that things come across as very accusatory and unbalanced. Believe me, I am very aware of both improprieties and just plain incompetence in intelligence agencies, and they need to be brought out  but in an encylopedic, not fragmentary and accusatory way.

 IPA - what 

I read the main page of the article on IPA.
On the plus side it is clear.
On the minus side, it makes no attempt to explain what the IPA is.  (context, scope, purpose, etc.)
Nice chart.  Lots of data (for people who probably have no need of it) but virtually no general information.
My questions (which weren't answered - keep in mind I'm a totally lay person):
An alphabet is used to 1.  Communicate between a writer and a reader (of the same language), 2.  Describe that communication (unambigously?)  Right?

Certain things are implied by its name, but clearly one should define what the subject of the alphabet is (are).  I have no idea if it covers all indoeuropean languages not to mention Mandarin Chinese (etc.)?
Does it (attempt) to cover all spoken languages? Written?  What about non-vocal languages (finger snaps - all that stuff).  Sign-language?  We now have some evidence that hand gestures are linked to language in the brain...but I digress.  From a simplistic point of view language can be thought of as being three distinct (context sensitive) types of communication: written/read, spoken/heard and performed/viewed.  I suppose an alphabet can't cover the last (but see how choreographers describe dance) and, obviously, there are non-alphabetical languages (pictographics, heiroglyphic, etc.) just as there are languages which make use of whistles, clicks.  SO what does the IPA do?

It just occured to me that maybe the IPA is (now-a-days) only used by euro-centric hobbyists and that would explain why there was no attention given to giving a serious explanation of what it is: """"if you have to ask...{then you don't need to know}""""""",0,0,0,0,0,0

That's a very a-historical point of view. The church was coming out with doctrinal statements about the trinity, and the Arians were twisting them and believing them. So the church went back and clarified what they meant. That's why some of the creeds are quite amazingly pedantic.

It's also a non-sensical point of view. You can't believe a bunch of words devoid of underlying meaning. You either believe them as they were meant, you mis-interpret them and thus mis-believe them, or you pretend to believe them. But there is no such thing as believing them without having a modicum of understanding. Sure you can believe some words are """"from God"""" but not know what they mean, but then you don't believe the doctrine you believe that there are some words that are true.

Augustine directly links God being external to time with the begetting of the Son. Now if you have a  different point of view, prove it! Otherwise it is just hand-waving and show.

> Don't understand the sentence above. Pfortuny 

People are interested in the relationship between biblical doctrine and science. What is the problem with a ONE LINE reference?

>Now my question is, have any published theologians linked Einstein's theories 
>about time with the eternity of God?

There's plenty of people thinking about this issue. Lewis is a published theologian is he not? Here is a paper from a college dealing with it....

Instead of opinions, let's have have evidence from church fathers.

>No, it is not that the filioque is fact or oppinion what matters here. What

The doctrine of the church is important, but what it means is irrelevant? Come on!! Why look up Wik if not to find out what something means? You don't need Wik to read the Athanasian creed. You need Wik to *understand* it in its historical context.

> To answer your first question, the Church defines which beliefs are dogma

Then point me to where I can buy a book or books which is the final word on Christian dogma. Then I can verify for myself what parts of this article are dogma and which are opinion. Don't say the bible because it doesn't mention eternal generation.

>For Orthodox at least, it's a """"theological opinion"""" that Mary lived a sinless 
>life

Ah huh! But for Catholics it is DOGMA. Thus what is and isn't dogma the OPINION of different churches and persons.

At the end of the day folks, I have taken a quote from a church father that directly addresses the issue of """"eternally begotten"""" to explain to the reader the meaning. To take it down you would have to show either

a) Augustine was out of step with the rest of the church at this point.
b) The church was so confused, there are too many theories to discuss.

But to just say """"let it be a mystery! Don't tell them what it means!"""", sorry that doesn't wash.

How is Marxism considered to be at odds with Darwinism? In some Fascistic sense maybe? Marxism is supposed to be about an economic-social science; Darwin about biological science. Marxist teleology is as much political stance as it is analytic, if it even is analytic at all. In fact Marx's precise invocation of Hegel was in order to expunge the latter's idealist teleology and his focus on 'identity' (hence Marx's book 'the Poverty of Philosophy), and then to take synthetic (dialectical) method and apply it to material history.

==WARNING: MEMBER THE WIKIPEDIAN GREEK NATIONALISTIC JUNTA. By User:Balkan ==
There’s a well collaborated (London based) group of GREEK Wikipedia sysops/users that  has been spotted to  work systematically in full daily basis propagandazing ultra natioanalistic Greek POV, and distorting related articles. They intervene in any Balkan history and politics related  article, pushing Greek POV, launch edit wars,  and repeated reverts of  vandalized by them versions, permanent deletions, block users, merges and redirects to deletetion of undesired new articles. Their main target is to distort all articles lelated to  ISLAM, TURKEY, REBUBLIC OF MACEDONIA, BULGARIA, ALBANIA (CHAMERIA), THEIR MINORITIES IN GREECE AND THEIR HISTORY. They attack  every article criticizing Greece transforming it  to Greekish propaganda POV. They became maniacs in optimizing dark side of Greek history.They communicate each other by secret e-mails avoiding messages through their talk pages to avoid publicity. This group acting in a systematic way to revert articles, when one of member makes the limit of 3 reverts, one another continues with 4th revert to avoid punishment for violating 3rv rule.

Furthermore they are suspected agents of Greek National Intelligence Service (E.Y.Π. Κυπατζήδες) and  believers of ultra nationalistic organizations of Greek “national interests”, as L.A.O.S. and Chrissi Avgi. They are also multiple sockpuppets and impersonators of their group members. They are all schizophrenics web vandals unacceptible to wikipedian community. Balkan history has labelled such people as GREKOMANS, a form of mental malignacy cited in Larousse dictionaries. Their illusion is MEGALI IDEA of Greek nationalism-expandism.They have been allied with Armenian, Serbian and Cypriot extremists of similar interest. THEY HAVE CONSTITUTED A WIKIPEDIAN GUNG, A GREEK PRAPAGANDA LOBBY, A GREEK EPSILON TEAM. All member of group are very radical nationalists. They work continously in three shifts over day and night.

Hi, I've edited the China/Temp page:

It's less objectionable, but I still have a small problem with it.  The basic problem is that is seems to imply the the PRC """"owns"""" say the history of Tang Dynasty.  Also,
it doesn't really take into account current events.  One of
the things that the PRC government has been doing in the past year has been to """"delink"""" the concept of the PRC from the concept of China.  You can see this in the response to Chen Shuibian that was issued today where the PRC was
went out of its way to avoid identifying the PRC with China.

I'll probably drop out of the discussion for a few days and
let other people comment (as well as try to articulate better what still bothers me about the page).

 User:Roadrunner

 Ok, we're moving towards a solution, so that's good. As for the Tang dynasty (though I think you mean it more genral), I think that Taiwan did not form part of the Tang empire. Anyway, there's nothing against mentioning the Tang dynasty at Taiwan as well.

 We may indeed specifically include (in the history? header? """"disclaimer""""?) that the PRC avoids linking its name to China. Then again, it may de-link it formally, but all those people around the world will continue to associate the two. 

 I'll await your remaining problems with the contents, confident we'll end up with an article that satisfies the both of us (and, hopefully, """"everybody else"""").  13:07 Aug 5, 2002 (PDT)

Guys, after reading this tedious list of conversation, my sugguestion of the best way out of the naming convention of China is using those by native speakers of Chinese. As a native speaker of several dialects of Chinese, I make the following table which should help: 

How native Chinese speakers refer to:
Speakers from
Mainland China
Taiwan
HongKong
Macau

Referring to China (Mainland)
China
Mainland (daliu)
Mainland or Zhongguo Daliu (chong-gua-da-lok in Cantonese)
Mainland

Taiwan
Taiwan or Taiwan Province (the more official tone)
Taiwan
Taiwan
Taiwan

China (the culture etc., non-political issue
China
China
China
China

Most Chinese, regardless of where they are from, care less about the naming convention but some Taiwanese (like my buddy who is gonna marry next month) DO NOT WANT Mainland China to annex Taiwan and had bad impression on Chen Shuibian.

KT2

 Knowing what the Chinese call it is certainly interesting, but what is important is what the English-language people call it. 

I'm with Jeronimo. I also thought all of this already had been resolved  China should be the main article of the PRoC. It doesn't matter what they officially call it or want it to be called. English speakers call it China in overwhelming numbers. This is also the conventional short form used by the CIA and the UN and we have decided that that is what we will use for country names here. If we don't stick to that then we are expressly taking sides in political naming issues. The fact that the PRoC is currently trying to dissociate their government from """"China"""" (which seems counter intuitive for a totalitarian regime..) is an interesting thing to mention in the article on the PRoC at China. If we change the name of the article to follow political correctness of the PRoC that is an express act of support for their policy. I for one say we defer such naming matters to higher authorities such as the CIA Factbook, the UN and especially what is most commonly used by English speakers. True they are POV institutions but transcribing what they use is a passive and not express act of POV. Wikipedia is not in the business to decide what the names of nations are  other institutions are far better suited at this highly charged topic.

 Blanco, Hitler and Mussolini 

Just some small factual stuff, in the section Spain After Franco, it is said that Adm. Blanco was killed by a car bomb, but he wasn't, the ETA had instead placed a bomb in a tunnel underneath the car and exploded it as Blanco drove on the street above.

Also, in the section Relationship with Hitler and Mussolini, it says: """"While Franco ruled undemocratically, he seems to have reluctantly accepted that Spain would be a democracy after his death."""" This isn't true at all, the only reason Franco worked with the western democracies was because Spain was in dire need of the supplies they could provide for Spain's weak economy, and later on, during the 50's and 60's, it was because Franco's advisors realized the need for Spain to take place in the burgeoning international economy. Franco was a devout enemy of democracy, and thought throughout his entire life that it would lead to anarchy or communism.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Listing the squadrons and their aircraft types is too much /for this article/ but not too much for Wikipedia. Only listing the serial numbers, pilots or other minutiae is too much for Wikipedia. One way you could try would be to create a """"sandbox"""" page for yourself, say User:FFA P-16/Sandbox, write up the squadrons as best you can and then ask at Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Aircraft‎ if we can look at it, tidy up the English, etc. and advise on the best page to put it on. Ground instruction airframes are not notable unless there is some special reason, for example if the airframe itself is notable from earlier in its life. 
Re. the ordering of the list, I would have to think about that but it is really a separate discussion. 
You say that the serial numbering (tail numbering) uses a special system. I would like to see this system explained, but it needs just a few examples to show the principles, not the whole list.
If Swiss writers routinely quote the serial number of an aircraft when writing about it, as a way of showing the information contained in the number, then you should be able to reference this. Such references might convince us that the Swiss Air Force is an exception to the general rule. We Wikipedia editors do like to see hard evidence, not just another editor's word. And, as you have noticed, we sadly know little of the Swiss Air Force unless someone can find reliable sources for us. — Cheers,  (Talk)

 Weeping Frenchman question

This note is to justify a change in a photo caption.
I have added a well-known historic photo to this page, of a Parisian weeping as German troops occupy his city.  Little is known of the origins of this photo, certainly not the identity of the man or why he cries.  It has been widely assumed that he is sorrowful, since he is witnessing foreign troops enter his home, the surrender of his armed forces, and the capitulation of his government.  I had always understood that this was the general sentiment throughout France, and certainly in occupied (non-Vichy) France.
The original caption stated simply that the man weeps.  This was the caption provided by the photo source (www.archives.gov) and the same caption that appears elsewhere in Wikipedia.  The new caption adds """"in joy or sorrow"""".  The addition adds unnecessary ambiguity, and makes a strong implication away from the general consensus on this photo.

Regrettably, I have to agree about the Gameplay section. It comes off more like an academic discourse on the incorporation of multiple characters and changes from previous franchise entries in video games, using Mother 3 as an example, than a proper encyclopedic entry. I won't quickfail just for this, but I do want it fixed before I'll pass. I'd prefer the section to be rewritten entirely, but some glaring points follow:
""""Mother 3 is presented in eight chapters with rotating player-characters including the protagonist's """"cowboy father"""", the """"family dog"""", an """"inept thief"""", and """"abused monkey"""""""" - So is the protagonist not playable? How large is the party? Why are these descriptions in quotes? - it suggests equivocation in your understanding of the characters. Actually, why isn't the protagonist named in this section? Again, I completely understand the desire to approach this from an out-of-universe perspective, but only to the point where the prose doesn't trip over its own detachment.
""""Mother 3 begins with naming the members of the player-character's family along with questions of the player's favorite food and """"thing"""",[3] and opens to a """"pastoral forest village"""" soon interrupted by a forest fire and the Pig Mask Army, who impose police state-like conditions on the village.[2] With the fire's outbreak, the father ventures out to protect his family (twin sons Lucas and Claus and wife Hinawa), but the rest of the world is eventually implicated in the plot.[1] They set out to take down the Pig Mask Army.[4] Lucas, the game's hero, does not become prominent until the fourth chapter. The game features a lighthearted plot, with enemies like """"partying ghosts"""" and """"talking rope snakes"""".[5] Porky, a character from EarthBound, appears as the leader of the Pig Mask Army and is the game's main antagonist. In addition, other EarthBound characters, such as Dr. Andonuts and Mr. Saturn, also appear."""" - Why isn't this stuff in Plot? The cast of characters does need to be introduced better, but jamming plot details into Gameplay isn't the way to do that.
The second paragraph is better; it's more in line with what I expect from a GA gameplay section. At least, it's good until """"Apart from this rhythm and combo mechanic, the battle system is similar to that of its predecessor."""" What's the predecessor's battle system like? Remember, not everyone reading this has played EarthBound.
""""There is no need to grind for experience and it has no random battles"""" - First of all, this should start off with a """"However"""" or something of the like as its predecessor does have those things. The information is also lacking, though - why isn't there a need to grind for experience? I think of this as one of the central, love-it-or-hate-it JRPG mechanics, and I'm curious as to how the genre might work without it. Imagine reading a Pokémon game article that simply states that you can change your party as needed (which is unusual for a JRPG) without giving a brief overview of how the PC and Day Care systems work - that's how I feel reading this.
"""" and lets the player see their magic """"PSI power"""" abilities"""" - Viewing your abilities probably isn't a necessary gameplay detail, but why isn't there anything on the abilities themselves and their use in battle? And do they have uses outside battle, like HMs, Rock Smash, Secret Power, and Softboiled do in Pokémon?
""""While Mother 3's music is both similar in tone to its predecessors and completely new, it features similar sound effects."""" - By """"completely new"""" do you mean it isn't recycled wholesale, or that the style is somehow new? Also, this bit probably doesn't belong in Gameplay.

If you're up to rewriting this, which I encourage - especially if you're shooting for FA - I'd recommend a structure like the following:
Paragraph 1: It's a top-down JRPG, there's an overworld, you explore towns with your team of characters, yada yada yada.
Paragraph 2: There are battles, they're not random (with an explanation of the conditions under which you do encounter battles - is it like in Pokémon Colosseum where you only fight other Trainers, or like in Dragon Ball Z: Buu's Fury where you can see the enemies on the overworld before fighting them?), this is how the battle system works, this is how items work, this is how experience points/leveling work (again, how is this the case without grinding? Or is a different system used entirely?).
Paragraph 3: Your team consists of such-and-such a number of characters, they change with different events in the story, characters do/don't return once they leave, here are examples of the characters and how they differ in and out of battle.
Stuff like items and saving (can you save anywhere?) - work in wherever you want; I'm not picky.   21:47, 25 September 2014 (UTC",0,0,0,0,0,0

what context does """"enlargement of government power"""" belong here?
It does not belong. Progressives do not wish to enlarge government power for the sake of enlarging government power. Progressives believe that modern society needs government intervention to ensure fair play, e.g. government regulation, and to protect the citizens, e.g. universal health care. Beck believes these are fringe views, but I do not. TFD seems to believe that believing in Progressive values is fringe, but he would be on Beck's side with side with that.
""""You have taken the quote out of context and the source is a high school textbook,""""
It is from Brittanica, and here is the full quote:
Origins of progressivism
Never were superficial signs more deceiving. Actually, the United States already was in the first stages of what historians came to call the Progressive movement. Generally speaking, progressivism was the response of various groups to problems raised by the rapid industrialization and urbanization that followed the Civil War. These problems included the spread of slums and poverty; the exploitation of labour; the breakdown of democratic government in the cities and states caused by the emergence of political organizations, or machines, allied with business interests; and a rapid movement toward financial and industrial concentration. Many Americans feared that their historic traditions of responsible democratic government and free economic opportunity for all were being destroyed by gigantic combinations of economic and political power.

Actually there was not, either in the 1890s or later, any single Progressive movement. The numerous movements for reform on the local, state, and national levels were too diverse, and sometimes too mutually antagonistic, ever to coalesce into a national crusade. But they were generally motivated by common assumptions and goals—e.g., the repudiation of individualism and laissez-faire, concern for the underprivileged and downtrodden, the control of government by the rank and file, and the enlargement of governmental power in order to bring industry and finance under a measure of popular control.
This is very non-ambiguous
This is an article from Center for American Progress the biggest Progressive group in America, and in it it describes in detail the origins of the progressive movement and it's continuance today.
""""What is progressivism?
Progressivism at its core is grounded in the idea of progress—moving beyond the status quo to more equal and just social conditions consistent with original American democratic principles such as freedom, equality, and the common good. Progressivism as an  intellectual movement emerged between 1890 and 1920 as a response to the multitude of problems associated with the industrialization of the U.S. economy—frequent economic depressions, political corruption, rising poverty, low wages, poor working conditions, tenement living, child labor, lack of collective bargaining power, unsafe consumer products, and the misuse of natural resources.
""""As a philosophical tradition, progressivism in its most complete form developed as a “new liberalism” for a new century—updating the American liberal tradition from its Jeffersonian, small-government, republican roots best suited for the agrarian economy of the nation’s founding era to a more democratic and modern liberalism capable of checking rising corporate power. The original progressives argued that changes in the economy’s organization required a more complete understanding of human freedom, equality, and opportunity that Jefferson championed so persuasively. Progressives believed that formal legal freedom alone—the negative protections against government intrusions on personal liberty—were not enough to provide the effective freedom necessary for citizens to fulfill their human potential in an age of rising inequality, paltry wages, and labor abuses. Changed conditions demanded a changed defense of human liberty.""""
With the rise of the contemporary progressive movement and the election of President Barack Obama in 2008, there is extensive public interest in better understanding the origins, values, and intellectual strands of progressivism. Who were the original progressive thinkers and activists? Where did their ideas come from and what motivated their beliefs and actions? What were their main goals for society and government? How did their ideas influence or diverge from alternative social doctrines? How do their ideas and beliefs relate to contemporary progressivism?

939a3642bac41f5d,"""I am not sure. If the word """"denialist"""" is new (which it is), you are unlikely to find a source calling an organization 100 or 150 years ago """"denialist"""". You might find all the characteristics of what denialism is of course. 

It depends on how you define denialism. If we define it very narrowly, we will only end up with 1 or 2 topics in the category of denialism, which clearly is wrong given the similarities of human behavior in those one or two areas with those in other subjects. 

I believe we should do what dictionaries do when they define a word: we look at prominent sources like the New York Times, the New York Review of Books, the London Times, the Economist, the Wall Street Journal, Academic  journals, scholarly writing, popular novels, etc to see how the word is used. For a new word, this determines its meaning, until a family of dictionary editors codifies this set of meanings as a family of different definitions that are published in dictionaries. Since we are not yet at the dictionary publication stage, but at the earlier pre- dictionary publication stage, we have to do more of the hard work ourselves. That is all. 

It is clearly a common word, in common usage, at least in some subject areas. One rarely hears the word """"AIDS denier"""" although that is essentially what an """"AIDS denialist"""" is (parenthetically noting that in fact an AIDS denialist is really an """"HIV denialist"""", properly speaking). And I suspect the phrase """"Holocaust denier"""" will fade from usage now that the new word """"denialist"""" seems to be gaining popularity. 

If one maintains that there are two separate groups, denialists and deniers, then why are there no AIDS deniers? Why no HIV deniers? Only denialists? Seems a bit strange, given that human behavior is not much different in all these cases; only the topic changes. The denying stays the same. 

If putting someone in a denialism category constitutes libel, then a very large number of publications worldwide have put themselves in legal jeopardy by publishing articles on AIDS denialists and other kinds of denialists. Given that these publications have full time legal staff and large legal budgets, and the people making these claims on Wikipedia are not lawyers or legal experts, this claim seems dubious at best. 

If we accept the gratuitous personal assertions of some that denialism is really a political movement that involves personal gain, then creationists, creation scientists and intelligent design promoters fall in this category. If """"denialism"""" is more like denial of the evidence, then this is less obviously true, since there is a dispute about the evidence in these cases. 

If we define """"denialism"""" as some here claim, to only mean those that know they are lying about the truth, then where does that leave the most common usage of the word in the phrase """"AIDS denialism"""" ? It obviously cannot mean """"lying knowingly"""" in this case, or probably in all cases. 

I suggest that if one requires a publication to directly make the claim that """"X is a Y"""", to put some article in a category, then we would depopulate most of the categories on Wikipedia. If Y has characteristics {Y1, Y2, Y3, Y4...Yn} from dictionary definitions or from common usage, and this common usage is well-understood and evident from publication in WP:V and WP:RS sources as defined above, and if X has most if not all of the characteristics {Y1, Y2, Y3...Yn}, then surely X can be put in the category Y. 

For example, suppose we define a new type of urban area called a """"Townlet"""", being an area with a common administration within a radius of 5 kilometers and a permanent human population of 5000-10000 people. Then one surely does not need a publication to state that """"Filllsberg is a Townlet"""" to put Filllsberg, meeting all the necessary criteria, in the category """"Townlet"""". 
 
I also vehemently deny the assertion that """"denialist"""" is a singularly negative category and so should not be used. If so, we would get rid of a large number of categories, such as """"pseudoscience"""". 

Also, as I have stated repeatedly, """"transhumanists"""" or """"secular humanists"""" or """"aetheists"""" might be viewed as denialists by some. And might feel perfectly proud to proclaim themselves as denialists of some overwhelming belief or putative evidence. 

For these reasons, I think there is nothing wrong with having a category called """"denialist"""", or """"denialism"""". The membership of this category might be controversial, depending on what we take as the definition of the word. Any particular subject might or might not be put in that category, given community consensus on the word's definition, and on the individual case by case analysis of any particular topic, subject or article.

I generally agree with Dr. Blofeld here.

At one time, this may have been a good way to incentivize people to write new articles on interesting topics, now it may be leading to unnecessary recentism as well as limiting the scope of what ought to be one of our most amazing and charming front page features.

You are Stalin apologets. Where is placed the mention of Katyin massacre, where several thousands of polish POVs were shot by NKVD upon Stalin's personal order? We hugarians are very close brothers of the polish people historically, so I find the lack of proper and emphasized mention of Katyin very painful. Stalin's crimes against Poland are amongst the most outrageous in written history. There is no excuse to the Molotov-Rippentropp pact. Make no mistake that was the Hitler-Stalin pact.

I really wish Stalin ruled you, not us. You are like Rumsfeld, who met Saddam during mid-1980s and praised him as a good ally in the anti-Khomeini Iran war. When will you realize that Putyin's current rule is an analog of Stalin's, characterized by extreme disregard for law, anti-semitism (most notably the early 50's doctor trials vs. 2004's Khodorkovski-Yukos) and imperialism (brutal military actions in the Caucasian Mountains both times and desire to the rule neighbours). Thus, by not mentioning Stalins criminality in unambigious terms, you hold the english-speaking world blind to Putyin's methods and you contribute to a """"new Uncle Joe"""" sentiment, which will inevitable put the world and the poor Russian race in great danger. A repetition of history for those who refuse to learn about the past.

Stalin started his reign with a few million dead, by reversing Lenin's post-civil-war """"new economic policy"""" of limited private agriculture thus leading to big famine.

The entire WWII in Europe would be over in 6-9 months had Stalin failed to entirely decapitate the soviet army's elite in 1937-39, this is clearly written in vol. 2. of soviet published seven-volume """"The history of the Great Patriotic War 1941-1945"""". You are plain stupid to praise Stalin for a """"hard earned victory in WWII"""".

So powerful was the fear of Stalin's evil power, that even us hungarians, who previously fought three revolutions and independence wars in the last 300 years, did not dare to raise again until autumn 1956 to free ourselves from stalinism. Anglo-saxons betrayed us big time then, shame on the Free World.

In churches renovated after WWII (big destruction in Hungary) the face of the Satan (as defeated by arch-angel Michael) is always of Josif Stalin's on wall paintings. People were shot for painting that.

Ms Gundagai, normally I would be thrilled to be the centre of so much attention (so far all your edits, except those to your userpage, have been devoted to me), but article talk pages are for discussing the article, not for making personal attacks on other users. If you wish to give me feedback, I would be most interested to read it. The appropriate place for such postings is my userpage, not article or project space.
If you truly object to editors """"fiddling...and inteferring with some else's words,"""" then you might want to consider whether Wikipedia is the right place for you. Every time you make an edit, you acknowledge acceptance that your edits may be edited any number of times by any number of people. At the bottom of each edit page is this statement: """"If you don't want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistributed by others, do not submit it.""""
I strongly caution you about continuing to make personal attacks on other users. The community condemns personal attacks, and should you choose to continue making them, it will result in further and longer range blocks. It's very easy to avoid such blocks by simply commenting on article content instead of editors. I'm sure we can all work together constructively and productively if we refrain from making comments about other users.
I am very pleased that you now have an account and I think this is a sign of good faith on your behalf. So thankyou for that. I hope we are able to get these issues resolved so you may be able to enjoy contributing to Wikipedia. Sarah Ewart (Talk) """"""",1,0,0,0,0,0

 Comments from RHB 

I am approaching this as someone who knows very little about the subject. I will give some high-level comments mainly on structure and content. There are copyediting and prose issues as well, but it is probably worthwhile to tackle the general problems before going into specifics. Before I start, one general point that you will see often in my comments is that there are at times new subjects that are suddenly introduced. Although wikilinks help, a clause or a few words of explanation would smooth the flow of reading for a person not familiar with the subject.

Background to the mission
This section seems a little long relative to the rest of the article. Unless there is a significant expansion planned for the rest of the article, I would recommend reducing this section. There are small details that do not add very much to the Augustine story, e.g., the origin of St Martin’s Church, the fair-haired slaves theory, the pope writing to various kings.
Bede is suddenly introduced without explanation.

Arrival and first efforts
The mission turning back to Rome is not explained. Is there a significance to what happened?
It says “…on the one hand… on the other hand…” but the two items mentioned do not seem to be in opposition as expected when this phrasing is used.
Augustine established first at Canterbury. Since he was the originator, it might be good to give a reason why he chose the location.
The Archbishop of Arles is suddenly introduced. Who is he? Was he based in Arles (in modern-day France) or in Kent? The existence of an Archbishop implies a significant Christian population existing on British soil. This then brings more questions to mind.
It says """"That Christmas…"""". But what year is that?
The king became a saint after his death, but the sentence may be in the wrong place. Did the king die shortly after Augustine's arrival?
In the same paragraph, some information of the existence of Christians before Augustine's arrival is given. This info should go before the discussion of Augustine's arrival.
Mellitus and Justus are suddenly introduced without explanation.
The sentence """"A theory by the historian S. Brechter…"""" is either a run-on sentence or is incomplete.

Additional work
After the first sentence describing the two episcopal sees, there is a sudden jump to after 1066 and a discussion of a cathedral. How are they linked? Also what cathedral is it? The description of the archeology seems out of place in the """"Additional work"""" section. Is it meant to show that Augustine managed to build new churches?
If Aethelbert was only the King of Kent, how was he able to summon bishops outside his realm?
There is a sudden introduction of the tonsure.

Further success
Concerning """"temples and usages"""" is that """"temples and their use""""? The """"former… latter"""" construct does not work very well here.
Concerning the quote """"whoever wishes…"""", who said that?

I would recommend reading the article out loud. I think you will find some sentence structures that seem a bit complex or difficult to understand. Following the corrections, a good copyedit/prose check is needed. I give as an example, the sentence """"As to why Pope Gregory…"""" could be made better as in """"Nothing is mentioned in the sources on why Pope Gregory chose a monk to head the mission"""".

Hello Attilios! First, thanks for your appreciative comments! I certainly plan to complete and bring the rest of the Isaurian period article to the same level, and then probably do the Amorian period too, for they are perhaps the most under-appreciated periods in the Empire's history. The other periods also need lots of work of course, but it will be some time before I will be able to do anything about that. I've got a couple of dozen ongoing projects or other articles I want to do, so time is short. Any help you can offer will, of course, be appreciated, be it pointing out an unclear sentence or a mistake, or adding some important point you feel I overlooked. Just be bold and edit. Since Byzantium is an area where only a handful of editors are active, IMO, if you can go ahead and write up even a sketchy, rudimentary outline on some of these topics (e.g. the horribly short Byzantium under the Justinian dynasty), you'd be helping a great deal. And if you can bring some respectable Italian sources in, that'd be a further bonus.

For the map, it has some problems, and I have been revising it for some time now, although the present status is still nowhere near good enough for it to be uploaded. For Naples and Gaeta, both cities are usually listed as acknowledging at least nominal Byzantine suzerainty at the time, their rulers accepting Byzantine titles etc. Now I admit that Byzantine Italy is not my field of expertise, so if you have some good sources to show otherwise, I'll change that too.

I don't think statistical tests are the way to go, honestly.  I think that the numbers actually hurt this case.  Instead, I hope to develop tools that find patterns suggestive of quacking.  One of the main complaints is that these methods are untested, so I would first and foremost like to test them against real accounts on RFCU—before the ip check results are posted.  If I can establish a good track record there, then it should engender some confidence that these methods are reliable.

One way to do this is by making a battery of tests. When most of the tests do or do not suggest socking, I would post predictions. Over time, it should be possible to determine which tests are most strongly correlated with sock puppets among different classes of socks—and there are at least two classes: regular and proxy socks.

 Learn how to add pictures and this live chart to the article.

 Add history section

 Add current and future studies done with the telescope.

Hi, and thanks for you work on the Dallas, Texas neighborhoods.  

I do disagree with your move of Deep Ellum to Deep Ellum, Dallas, Texas both (1) because a google search seems to turn up no other Deep Ellums in the world, thus there is no need for the more complex title and (2) because the cut-and-paste move eliminates the page history (which is sketchy because our license, the GFDL, requires it).  

The appropriate thing to do when trying to move a page to an already existing location is to request a move at Wikipedia:Requested moves.  A week or so after listing there, an administrator sees if there is consensus on the article's talk page to move, and then, in this case, would swap redirect and article locations, with page history, talk page and all.  What I'm going to do is place a  on both articles and list it at WP:RM so an administrator can fix it at whichever location is decided by consensus.   | Talk",0,0,0,0,0,0

 More description of location please? 

Hello, I wondered if someone with the requisite local knowledge would please consider adding a short sentence, maybe in the description section, to explain where this bridge is? I do appreciate that its location is already described in the lead as crossing between things X and Y but if you don't already know Stockton well (or recently!) this is not necessarily all that helpful. I was wondering if you could write a more bottom-up description which says something like """"the bridge crosses the Tees at blah (or near Blah Street etc); it is A hundred metres downstream from the Foo Bridge and B hundred metres upstream from the Bar Barrage"""" or whatever, which it seems to me would nail it in more empirical terms. What do you think? Any yes, of course the maps link does nail it (assuming the co-ordinates are right!) but something in the text which helps in this way would, I think, be very useful. I may be being unusually thick  (happens all the time, actually) but on my first reading - and I was last in Stockton in 2007, you see - I was not at all sure where it was, wondering if in fact it replaced the other rather nice pedestrian bridge closer to the town centre. I cured this uncertainty by looking at the maps, yes, but the sentence I'm asking for would have given me more direct access to the knowledeg. Go on, please write it for me, you know you want to; and I will go and put the kettle on for you. Thanks and best wishes   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Theoretical justification for our tax system? 

I added this sentence to the lede...

""""The two main theories of taxation are the benefit theory and the ability to pay theory.""""

...which ‎Guest2625 removed with the explanation that this entry doesn't contain the """"terms"""" used in my sentence.  

There's a theoretical explanation for the world's current tax system...either that or we're all crazy.  If you're saying that this entry doesn't at all discuss the theoretical basis for our tax system...then clearly that's a problem.  You don't solve that problem by removing the one sentence that does mention the justification for our tax system...you solve it by creating the section that does provide the justification.  In order to do that...you first have to review all the references that I added to the benefit principle entry.  If you're not willing to make that effort...then please don't edit this entry. 

Having already read through all those reliable sources and many many many more...here's my take.  This paper...The Pure Theory of Public Expenditure...by Paul Samuelson has been cited over 5,000 times.  It provides the definitive theoretical justification for our tax system.  Samuelson's argument was that the benefit principle had a very limited scope because of the preference revelation problem...a problem which tax choice effectively solves. That's it...that's our tax system in a nutshell.  That's the bottom line that readers should not have to wade through miles of minor details to find.    """,0,0,0,0,0,0

So go ahead, try totally freezing me. I will simply write to the Wikipedia headquarters and request that they review the official record, and your biased actions and statements. I will quickly be restored to my privileges, because you have no case, and you are just harrasing me because of whatever prejudices, bias or immature resentments you harbor.

I could never be humiliated or embarrassed by a small person like you; administrators of your ilk have already demonstrated that you would be better taking kindergarten and grammar school over again than trying to manage and lead other people who have achieved adulthood long ago.

Good luck, you'll need it after you keep embarrassing yourself all the way into a deep hole.

9f042045a276f9de,"""first sentence of the article is wrong as it is on 1.22.2010, by 2 counts.
  1. It states ~""""since 1950"""". That would imply a constant temp forever before.
  2. It also states ~""""projected to continue"""". Regardless of the theories, that is not what GW means. AGW means that.
  3. Something else is off, but if I explain too much, your head will explode, and you'll just insult me. I cannot deny insults & just cry.
You guys (purposely left out gals) seem to be so non-scientific & picky-ooney, but are still off. Are most of you who are alarmists & cultists also gay? I'm looking to pack fudge.

e66948c1d0405efa,"""::I would say that the process of """"lumping"""" and """"splitting"""" is intimately connected to phylogenetics (not to cladistics) by the fact that reality is ambiguous, both in a momentary and in a historical perspective. This is actually the problem that cladists think is connected to the Linnean systematization, and try to solve with cladistics. However, cladistics does not solve the problem, but only transfers it into concepts, erroneously equalizing time with space. The problem (i.e., ambiguity) is actually the difference between reality and our comprehension of reality. This statement is extremely difficult to understand, although it is perfectly clear: the problem (i.e., ambiguity) is the difference between reality and our comprehension of reality. The problem to understand it may be due to that it is a difference, since a difference is unsolvable. This problem, that is, this fact, is consistently incorporated into concepts in a systematization of the Linnean kind (i.e., categories of categories). It means that the possibility for lumping and splitting is both necessary and unavoidable. An unambiguous conceptualization is simply impossible. The question whether this fact means that reality is ambiguous has to be answered with: yes. There is no way to escape this ambiguity. Mats Envall (presently at 83.254.20.53  ]

I try to never block for warring if protection will do the same job and they aren't famous repeaters.  It lets other editors hash it out.  I also said that any admin is free to revert me at WP:ANI.  Protection was just faster.  And yes, a little spicy Italian sausage mixed with zucchini and onions, lightly seasoned with garden fresh rosemary and other herbs, fried up hot and fast in a proper iron skillet, almost stir fry style.

 Translating 

Hi. I don't think there is any specific Wikipedia policy regarding the translation of names. For the article's title, I think you should have the band's untranslated, Spanish name. In the article, you can have the English translation in parentheses next to the Spanish name. You can do the same with the names of the songs. Hope that helps.   04:10, August 22, 2005 (UTC)""",0,0,0,0,0,0
