I'm in twothree minds over this proposal.

42fa6e7653786e2a,"""Ten commandments, part 2==
I'm getting tired of having to scroll through several pages to get to the bottom, so I'm starting a new section.  

Let's take a step back.  This article is the """"Ten Commandments"""".  That is the verses in Exodus 20:2–17 and Deuteronomy 5:6–21 that are universally called the Ten Commandments; the ones that are debated about being placed in public school; the ones that are talked about as the fundamental of morality.  It is not about the list in Exodus 34.  The article is not about the use of the words """"עשרת הדברות"""" in the Bible; it is about a particular Bible list that is called The Ten Commandments.

This is an important point, except that I would go further.  This article is not about a particular Bible list.  This is article about a cultural artifact known as """"the Ten Commandments"""" that is strongly influenced by the Bible.  Sections of the Bible have been translated, moved around, edited, cropped, etc., and then declared """"The Ten Commandments"""".  I think that many people think of the 10C as something where you just open the Bible up and there they are.  That's just not the case.  The cultural concept of """"The Ten Commandments"""" is significantly extra-bibical.  Haven't you ever seen that Late Show bit where Letternman takes someone's words and edits them to say something different from what they actually said?  You can't just say """"well, I've quoted the Bible, so it's a legitimate representation of the Bible.""""

You feel that this statement is not sourced.  Yet I am sure you agree that the number """"Ten"""" in the title """"The TEN Commandments"""" comes from the Hebrew phrase """"aseret had'varim"""" even if you personally think that this was a mistake. 

Actually, I remain unconvinced of this.  I have seen no convincing evidence that the Bible using the word """"ten"""" and people referring to the """"ten"""" commandments are causally connected.  I certainly am willing to accede that this may say more about my knowledge of Bible research rather than about the 10C.

I do not think there is a better way of telling the reader that the etymology of the title """"The Ten Commandments"""" for the list in Exodus 20:2–17 and Deuteronomy 5:6–21 is from the Hebrew """"aseret had'varim"""". 

So there are two problems immediately apparent here.  First, you have no cite for the claim that this is the etymology.  Secondly, even if it were the etymology, that would be an issue completely separate from whether the Bible actually says that.  After all, the etymology of the term """"Uncle Tom"""" goes back to a book by Stowe, even though the Uncle Tom character is not in fact an """"Uncle Tom"""".

Any reasonable person reading the text as it now is would conclude that the Bible, in the Ex 20 and De 5 passages, uses the term """"עשרת הדברות"""".  I don't see why you insist on retaining this misrepresentation.

This is a notable issue because, as you mentioned, the Ten Commandments are widely represented as being fundamental to Western Civilization.  Besides the numerous other problems with that claim, the fact that much of the importance given to """"The"""" Ten Commandments is extrabiblical opposes that view.

You say the original 1664 character set the boundary at the Hudson River, rather than the center of the channel. But it appears to me on the basis of some casual mouse clicks that the 1834 compact agreed that it does go down the center of the channel, which is indeed where all the road maps and things I've looked at show it.

As for the discussion of Voltaire's racism/anti-semitism we obviously must apply similar principles apply. Throwing in a few decontextualised quotes about Voltaire's view on Jews and black people to demonstrate that he was a raving racist is simply meaningless. If these issues are to be included in the entry at all (which I doubt they warrant), then surely they need contextualisation. For instance, Voltaire's discussion on Jews surely must be understood in the context of his general account of revealed religion, and must be set in the context of 18th-century censorship (which often led writers to attack the Jews whilst actually aiming at their Christian off-spring). Similarly, Voltaire's views on non-white people cannot be understood outside the context of his general framework of savagery, barbarism, civilisation and historical development. If people started to read Voltaire in such contexts, then they would start to understand that the question of whether Voltaire was a """"racist, anti-semitist, egalitarian, etc.""""? is pretty much meaningless and doesn't increase our understanding of him at all. However, given the above discussion, I sort of doubt whether wikipedia readers/editors understand enough history to appreciate this. In any case I give it a go, by deleting the presently pointless section on Voltaire's views on race ....

Comment about JJ Bulten

Greetings,

I would like to mention that I added 0% of the """"OR"""" tags and thus am innocent. I realize that when someone is trying to find a compromise, it is easier to blame """"both sides"""" for a conflict. However, on closer inspection, I would be willing to bet that a judge or jury would find that I am arguing on the merits of the Wiki-policies and outside sources, while JJB is using scorched-Earth tactics. Please consider this example:

    The evidence does not favor backing off from requesting a move, for compliance's sake, in some other polite way. First, the """"vote"""" remains 6-4 by my count: no consensus. Second, your unsourced statement of thousands of """"longevity myths"""" cites is probably a Google exaggeration based on estimated mirrors; see above where I sourced the real numbers as 92 vs. 91. Third, this exaggeration only reflects the fact that a vast number of """"myth"""" mirrors stem from Ryoung's wholly unsourced 2005 insertions. (The User:Shii/Hoaxes page normally considers this as evidence of hoaxing. See User talk:Shii/Hoaxes#Longevity, ticklish situation for 26 phrases originating from Ryoung that have exactly zero Google support outside his 2005 insertions.)

            Yet another FALSE accusation. There is no """"hoaxing"""" here at all, nor has there been any attempt at """"hoaxing."""" I am not responsible for third-party sites, but if they choose to copy my work, might it be because they consider it a reliable source?Ryoung122 

                Comment: Looking closer, we see that it was JJB that listed this as a """"hoax"""":

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Shii/Hoaxes#Longevity.2C_ticklish_situation

Citation of one's own accusation is a circular argument, and thus invalid.

In other words, JJBulten first adds material to Shi's page then cites his own add as """"proof"""" of hoaxing. Actually, it's only proof of his fanaticism, of hitting 'below the belt' in an attempt to radically remake this page in his own image. """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Three times today (28 Oct.) you have reverted the """"sinusoids"""" language to your preferred """"trigonometric functions"""" language, as I've tried various things to explain, reference, talk about it, etc.  Please engage rather than just reverting.  If you revert again, I'll report you for 3RR violation again.  

Neither you nor I are experts in the article subject matter (least squares spectral analysis). But I cited 2 references that literally say """"trigonometric functions"""", while your references all refer to another method (Fourier analysis) you freely interpret as to make it sound they refer to the article subject matter, though it is obvious they do not (in your mind, as you claimed it explicitly, Fourier analysis is still the same as least-squares spectral analysis, which is obviously a nonsense because WP has two completely separate articles both featured on WP main page btw).  So I do not believe anyone any more will buy your misusing of Wikipedia regulations. There is no reversals here, not even technically speaking; because what is going on is mine (article author’s) cleaning of all the shit you keep spraying around. Just like so many editors noted (everyone just look at Dicklyon’s talk page) that you engaged in edit wars or insults exchanges with so far. You are just a trouble maker around here and everyone sees you as such. Now stuff your imaginative misinterpretations of WP regulations to where they belong.  No 3RR violation on my part. But I know why you just threatened with reporting me: it is because I already mentioned to you today that you are in violation of 3RR yourself.

Well, all of that stuff came straight from either the NY appellate courts opinion or the US Supreme Court's opinion in that related case.  i will also try to find more sources.  This case is a landmark case because it established, for the first time ever, the civil tort of false light claims and what the elements of those claims are.  It was relied upon by SCOTUS as well as courts in all 50 states.  To be honest, this is probably the only thing this guy is known for (unless you lived way back in the 40's while he played).  That is why it is so important.  False light remains the least-recognized and most controversial aspect of invasion of privacy. See BRUCE W. SANFORD, LIBEL AND PRIVACY § 11.4.1 at 567 (2d ed. 1991) (""""Of Dean Prosser's four types of privacy torts, the 'false light' school has generated the most criticism because of its elusive, amorphous nature.""""); Diane Leenheer Zimmerman, False Light Invasion of Privacy: The Light that Failed , 64 N.Y.U.L. Rev. 364, 452 (1989) (""""the wiser course may be for states to eliminate false light altogether""""). In Time, Inc. v. Hill, 385 U.S. 374, 387-90, 17 L. Ed. 2d 456, 87 S. Ct. 534, the United States Supreme Court has held that the tort of false light is consistent with First Amendment freedoms provided there is a finding of actual malice, knowledge of the falsity, or of reckless disregard of the truth. See also Cantrell v. Forest City Publishing Co., 419 U.S. 245, 251-53, 42 L. Ed. 2d 419, 95 S. Ct. 465.

Just in this subject, I don’t talk about their whole competence. Don’t you agree?  As for the album a year on own label: Lucifugum is a self-releasing band just last 5 years (of 15 years existence). And it doesn’t make them less notable than they were in past. In interviews they explained their decision to make self-releases. It’s just because of a disappointment in labels which didn’t keep their word and promises (but NOT because of lack of interest to the band). “Vector 33” (the first album of  female fronted Lucifugum) was planned to be released on Drakkar prod., but  Drakkar didn’t release it in due time. That’s why Lucifugum have canceled the deal with Drakkar and released “Vector 33” cd by themselves. It was the first Propaganda cd release. Also in Lucifugum interviews I read that they don’t exclude the cooperation with labels in future if they find a noble label with honest principles. By the way, “Stigma Egoism” on Drakkar prod. is not a re-release, this is the first (and last at the moment) cd edition of this album (Propaganda released just tape version). Also Lucifugum released in 2003 two albums on BlackMetal.Com on cd format (a big independent American label with many releases and good financial might). I mean a critery for musicans, Lucifugum released 3 albums on big indie labels.    
P.S. They record an album a year (or almost a year) not just now, in early times they did the same things. Just look at their discography, they really work hard. By the way, my 1488 really means nothing, just nothing, believe you me or not. Thanks for your time and all the best.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Again, NK never existed as a region before 1920s. While Nagorno translates as mountainous, it was never a separate region. And NK as a region is separated from Armenia by Kelbajar, Lachin and other districts of Azerbaijan. The sources above do not say that NK existed as a stand alone region historically. Even Russian imperial administrative divisions such as Jevanshir and Shusha uyezds included both mountainous and lowland parts of the region. So we need to clarify that NK as a region did not border Armenia. If we are talking about geographic region of Karabakh, then its mountainous part extends right to the border with Armenia, however upper and lower Karabakh historically formed a single region, and geographic concept of Karabakh includes both highlands and lowlands.

Lloyd was born in Burchard, Nebraska, to James Darsie Lloyd (1865–1947) and Elizabeth Fraser (1869–1941); Harold's paternal great-grandparents were all from Wales. Young Harold was named for his paternal grandfather. Harold had an older brother, Gaylord (1888-1943), five years his senior. Like his younger brother, Gaylord acted in motion pictures, but his career was nowhere near as renowned as Harold's. Among other roles, he acted in 1921's """"Disraeli"""" starring the famous George Arliss.  With Harold's help, there were even efforts to turn him into a comedy star.  He eventually went on to become a film executive.  When Harold was a child, his parents divorced and Lloyd chose to stay with his father.  Despite this, he and his brother always remained close to their mother.  Harold's father was always dreaming up grand get-rich-quick schemes that ended in disasters. They eventually ended up in Omaha where Lloyd had his first acting experience in a local stock company. He attended East High School and San Diego High School and received his stage training at the School of Dramatic Art (San Diego). In 1912, his father J. Darsie """"Foxy"""" Lloyd was awarded the then-massive sum of $6,000 in a personal injury judgment (although this was split evenly between Lloyd and his lawyer) after being run over by an Omaha beer truck. Reportedly, on the toss of a coin (""""Heads is New York or Nashville or where I decide!, tails is San Diego""""), he and Lloyd moved west.

Lloyd had acted in various Vaudeville acts in theaters since boyhood, and started acting in one-reel film comedies shortly after moving to California. He soon began working with Thomas Edison's motion picture company, and eventually formed a partnership with fellow struggling actor and director Hal Roach, who had formed his own studio in 1913. The hard-working Lloyd became the most successful of Roach's comic actors between 1915 and 1919.

Davis retired from acting in 1923, the year she and Lloyd were married, and Jobyna Ralston became Lloyd's co-star.

From 1915 to 1917, Lloyd and Roach created more than 60 one-reel comedies.

 Disturbing trend to whitewash history 
I have noticed that some contributors to this article seem to be desperate to wash over the parallels between Islam and Islamist terrorism. You need not look further than the term """"Islamist terrorism"""" itself, which is improper grammar in English. I believe that the term is preferred to """"Islamic terrorism"""" because the latter seems, in their minds, to connote that terrorism is sanctioned in the religion. I personally despise this kind of thinking because it assumes that the reader is a moron who cannot discover the truth. I have seen this kind of handling of controversial subjects in other articles. I have even seen attempts to delete articles of that type from Wikipedia. I should probably note here that I am a liberal with no agenda here other than to comment.

PLease explain to me, sentence by sentence, why you have edited out the following addition:

The main impact zone of the crash was approximately 19 metres (57 feet) in width. No wreckage was found from the airliner within this impact zone or inside the building. The lawn immediately in front of the crash site was unmarked. Within the main impact zone was a hole that the object punched in the building, approximately 9 metres (27 feet) in width. The Pentagon is composed of five concentric rings. Only the outer three rings were penetrated. The upper floors of the first ring collapsed, but the structural integrity of the second and third rings remained. At the end of the third ring was a circular 'punch out' hole, again 9 metres (27 feet) in diameter. The wingspan of a Boeing 757 is 38 metres (114 feet). The vast majority of the mass of the aircraft remains unnaccounted for. For flight 77 to have caused the damage observed at the Pentagon, the wings would have had to have been broken off, pushed into the fuselage, after which the fueselage and wings would have had to have been compressed sufficiently to fit through the 9 metre hole. No physical mechanism by which this process could have occurred is known.

Flight 77 did not hit the pentagon. Its so obvious as to be comical. The capacity of human beings to believe what is demonstrably complete bullshit because they are afraid of going against the group consensus never ceases to amaze me. You are being lied to, day in, day out, by your media. Stop. Think. Please.

There are many long articles in Britannica .I remind you that this AE is  much studied in Univerities , and even schools  around the world . It requires therefore, the political  background as it had developed  . And  this investigation of dormancy must be clarified absolutely from  Institutional legislation . I repeat that I have long asked, such as Djmutex , to , to fill us in with a translation of these procedural changes. When , what ,  signed by Hindenburg?  Another decree ? Please supply and include it here, wherever else it may be needed .  Plase  include what Bruning  said about such dormancy- presunmably as this is cardinal , he referred to it at the time and afterwards in his memoirs.

Someone who has not seen this 'alphabet' used in practise before could conclude from the table and the examples provided that it is a more or less fixed transliteration system for Modern Standard Arabic. In reality, however, it is almost always used to transliterate spoken Arabic, i.e. dialects, and there is an enormous amount of variation. For example, contrary to what the table suggests, both س and ص are usually represented by 's'; the distinction by using a capital 'S' for ص looks very neat, but I have never seen it in use. I would therefore suggest to provide more realistic examples, such as: (Lebanese) kif/keef sa7tak, chou/shu 3am ta3mil? weyn baddak nitghada? etc. Maybe it should also be noted that - in parallel with Arabic writing - there is a tendency to omit vowels.79.219.118.88",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Response to Your defence of LGagnon. 

Please check appropriate, relevant and significant details before you post messages to the contrary at my User Page. That should be a basic minimum for any Administrator, I should think.

At the Ayn Rand Talk Page you will find evidence of my attempts to talk to Lgagnon. Just infra I post here a copy of my Memo to the Wikipedia Board articulating my frustration in this regard.

Sir(s)/Madam(Mesdames):

I continue to have problems with LGagnon at Wikipedia. He sends me the most ill-written messages. It is almost impossible to wade through the bad grammar, misspellings/typos; etc to get his point. He indulges the most foul personal attacks with regard to everyone, even Wikipedia admins, referring to the latter as """"vandal-coddling."""" He never backs up his unthinking assertions. He simply asserts.

Why does Wikipedia continue to indulge one  but one  lamentably under-educated vulgarian in this regard, to this degree? What could possibly be the explanation????!!!!!!!!

Please, Please, Please respond. I have tried to reason with the lad. I tried humour. I have issued warning after warning. He is as osmotically impervious to the ratiocinative as he is to any other recognizably human mode of intervention.

 Wikimedia blog post 

Hello, everyone.  Trying to be as polite and good faithy as possible here this morning.  I hope I won't be smited for pointing something out again.  The current Wikimedia Foundation blog post is Wikipedia for Schools Project.  The blog talks about how Wikipedia for Schools was born out of SOS Children.  It's a great project, providing underprivileged kids in the Third World with curated, age-appropriate content from Wikipedia.  But when you go to see who wrote the Wikipedia articles about the organization and the program, one can see the all too familiar pattern of editorial dominance by conflict-of-interest accounts.  Two days ago, a big chunk of content was added to SOS Children's Villages UK by User:RWilcox11.  Rainbow Wilcox happens to be Website Content Editor at SOS Children.  No disclosure by RWilcox11, so if that is indeed Ms. Wilcox, the edits are in violation of the Wikimedia Foundation's Terms of Use of this site.  Similarly, on Monday (the day the new Terms of Use went into effect), User:Rory.soschildren was working on the article.  Rory Hughes Social Media Marketer for SOS Children.  In a bit of contrast, User:JamieG01 identifies himself on his Talk page as follows, """"I work for an international children's charity called SOS Children"""", so we can assume this is Jamie Goodland who received """"special thanks"""" in the WMF blog post.  Likewise, User:DuncanHarris identifies on his User page, """"I am entirely responsible for the technical work on the 2007 Schools Wikipedia Selection. This work was funded by SOS Children UK (part of the world's largest orphan charity).""""  And User:BozMo identifies (as Andrew Cates) on his User page with, """"I also worked from 2004-2013 (part time as CEO) for the charity SOS Children.""""

Might I make a recommendation?  Now that the new Terms of Use is coming up on its first week of implementation, maybe someone from the Wikimedia blog staff could make it a point, that whenever they are featuring a person or an organization that has a relevant Wikipedia article, that part of the blogger's responsibility is to reach out to any potentially conflicted editors representing the blog subject, to ask them to self-identify per the new Terms of Use, so that the Wikimedia blog is not inadvertently showcasing violators of the Terms of Use of the Foundation's project.  To do my part, I will be happy to reach out now to Users RWilcox11 and Rory.soschildren, to let them know of this conversation.

There are some sketchy things going on with this talk page.

I cut and pasted it again here last week, and -voila!- the same text recommending deletion was archived again today! Hmmm... Anyway, these above entries are nice reports, though unfortunately they do not add much to the questions on notability. The concept of notability must be established through certain types of references (regardless of a person's opinion of the individual). The question is why/how does these references establish notability? If he's interviewed about something, that establishes the notability of the subject of the interview. Rather than saying """"this seems to me to [this or that]"""" - responses on this topic need to be """"this reference establishes/fails to establish notability because..."""" The further one reads into the wiki explanations about notability for people, these cites for Raymond do not have material that is even close:
The person has received a well-known and significant award or honor, or has been nominated for one several times. The person has made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in his or her specific field. Generally, a person who is """"part of the enduring historical record"""" will have been written about, in depth, independently in multiple history books on that field, by historians. A politician who has received """"significant press coverage"""" has been written about, in depth, independently in multiple news feature articles, by journalists. An actor who has been featured in magazines has been written about, in depth, independently in multiple magazine feature articles, by magazine article writers. An actor or TV personality who has """"an independent biography"""" has been written about, in depth, in a book, by an independent biographer. 
This Raymond page is obviously someone's baby, and someone who's account was removed due to sockpuppeting was posting on this talk page last year. That doesn't mean that Raymond shouldn't have a wikipedia page. But the references here don't add up to notability as notability has been described by wikipedia.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Seems like the perfect backdoor in avoiding charges of libel and defamation.

In fact, how about someone makes a collage of Zack Snyder and Frank Miller in photoshopped pictures performing fellatio and label it art? Libel, anyone? Defamation? If art is free, then certainly the wind may and must blow in all directions, just as much as a coin may have two sides. After all, through the argument of """"point of view"""", anything could be distributed as art. And why stop there? A sequel entailing their mothers could be appropriate, considering that the new best friends Snyder and Miller have confirmed a sequel.

Wikipedia operates under the neutral point of view. This means that we must represent all notable and sourced points of view on a topic (and be sure not to give undue weight to minority views). Your edits seem to be pushing a Christian POV, by removing certain articles from Category:Jesus while adding others to Category:God. I think the two clearest example of this is in this and this. Where else would we categorize an article dealing specifically with Jesus than in Category:Jesus? There is no reason to remove article just because they come from a Muslim or JW or Jewish point of view. Normally, if you make an edit, and someone else reverts it, that means there is no consensus for your edit (and therefore, you shouldn't make it again. Excessively re-adding controversial content is considered edit warring, and you can be blocked for this (see WP:3RR). What you need to do in these situations, is go to the talk page of the article and discuss your proposed changes to try and convince others and raise consensus to support your views. Users simply cannot force controversial edits into articles, that isn't how wikipedia works. I'll also note, that because of our NPOV policy, I see no reason or rationale to exclude many of the articles you have removed from the category Jesus.

 Your undo of my deletion re: article Jennifer Oneill pic of her speaking at a public forum 

TO MIKE WAZNOWSKI: Look, I was the one ANYWAY who submitted that pic of the subject of the article speaking at a public forum in Washington, D.C. because the prior pic was removed due
to an alleged copyright violation.  So your alleged basis for undoing my deletion was
not justified since I was the original one who submitted the pic in the first
place.This pic which was """"nominated for speedy deletion"""" was taken at a public forum
and submitted in good faith BY ME, but was deleted anyway.  ANDI DID INCLUDE AN EXPLANATION
and did not deem it necessary in the talk history to include this (i.e. info that a prior pic had been deleted) as it did absolutely nothing to contribute to the article. 

I would add that for some unknown reason, you continue to attack me personally and undo virtually all of my edits here. You even undo my edits on the talk page!

You are obviously intent on ENGAGING IN AN EDITING WAR WITH ME and I simply do not know why.

We've already discussed the Big Chin to death.  It was one of many allegations of photo manipulation dismissed by the HSCA. You want to mention it as if 1) it was never debunked 2) it's the most important thing ever 3) it is proof of conspiracy.    

Gamaliel, none of the three things you just wrote make any logical sense. 1)Some believe the chin is not a fabrication. So what? This doesn't mean these true believers have """"debunked"""" something. Its their opinion. The policy of this web site is to provide all opinions, and certainly not to hide the evidence. When are you going to understand this rule? 2) How important is it? It is relevant to Oswald's contention that some one was framing him. Whether that is the """"most important thing ever' is up to the reader. 3) Whether it is proof of a conspiracy is also up to the reader. 

Gamaliel, your frantic attempts to delete and hide any information that you disagree with is directly contrary to the web site rules. Why do you continue to do it?
 

Don't forget, there were two Oswald's. Lee Oswald and Harvey Oswald. One worked for the CIA and was the real triggerman, I forget which... But wait a minute, the fatal shot really came from the grassy knoll, from an anti-Castro Cuban, who wanted payback, for no air-support for Brigade 2506, during the Bay of Pigs disaster... No wait a minute Oswald was a paid hitman for the mafia...... oh well It's 3:37 in the AM, all this conspiracy stuff is making me loopy. Goodnight.
 

Gamaliel, is this person above who calls himself """"Mytwocents"""" your alter ego, and put in for comic relief?

 

Web site rules of inclusion of all significant viewpoints

The evidence of the fabricated photograph is a significant viewpoint that was discussed in the HSCA report. Some experts believe it shows fabricationsome don't. Under the rules of this web site all significant viewpoints should be presented. 

Claiming that someone else disagrees with a significant viewpoint on a subject is not a ground for excluding it from the article. 

Arguing it is not the """"most important thing ever"""" is not a ground for excluding the view point that the photographs are fabrications. 

Arguing that evidence that the photographs were fabricated is evidence of a conspiracy,  is not a ground for excluding the evidence.

Gentlemen. These are basic web site rules.

 

Leave this article in a readable state
Don't leave  after every goddamn sentence in a paragraph.  Use one tag; .  Free free to argue about content, but make sure the current content is at least readable.  I have just fixed a couple of paragraphs; I'm about to go after any others.

Control my anger?  What are you talking about?  I'm not in a position to verify either way - I just want to make sure that the article is readable for the users.

This article is not neutral

Surely it's not the job of Wikipedia contributors to decide whether or not Oswald worked alone, was part of a conspiracy or had anything to do with the assassination at all.  It seems to me that the only way of rendering a neutral article is to state that Oswald was arrested and held on suspicion of Kennedy's murder, but was killed before he could be tried.  It can then be provably stated that the Warren Commission, in its Report, concluded that Oswald was guilty and had worked alone, but that there have since been many efforts and arguments that attempt to disprove this conclusion.

Things I've learned at en.wikipedia
 When I made a change and I want that the edition appears, I am a user disruptive because I don't respect the previous edition. When I defend the previous edition, the concept """"previous edition"""" means nothing. Or the dates are ignored and I'm the disruptive again. The two solutions are good.

 Although it is not written anywhere, exist a rule that says that any offense expires in a few days. If you can not give notice of the offense (because you were blocked, ill or without computer for a mechanical failure...), bad luck for you. Here solutions, not justice. And that Pope Time erases the sins is a good solution.

 Open spaces for dialogue and discussion and pledge to respect the result is not a sign of wanting to do things right.

 Apparently appreciate the intention of a user is not feasible, but ignore two serious violations of the rules is perfectly acceptable.

 Administrators tend to be more ruthless with solitary users than with organized groups.

 If a user with a clean record discuss with another user with a non-clean record the administrator only monitor and punish the user with """"dirty"""" record. The other user will not have problems.

If there were no other convention, then Cork would already be a disambiguation page even without cork (material) to contend with.  However, the overriding convention appears to be (Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (Ireland-related articles)#Disambiguation of locations in Ireland):
Where a town and county have the same name, the county article should be named as County Countyname, and the town should be located at County/townname (if no further disambiguation is needed). For example, Sligo and County Sligo.
It's only a talk-page suggestion, but absent anything stronger it's unexceptionable.  However, throw cork (material) back into the mix and it's clear that it's not a contest between material and city; it's a contest between material, city and county.

I think the sockpuppet notice should be moved as a notice to the talk page. There was just one sockpuppet, and he is no longer using them and he (the main account) was not indef-blocked.  

 Page move vandalism 
Wikipedia has clear procedures on moving pages. Other than in exceptional circumstances all pages should be moved by following the instructions on the Requested Moves page. Unilateral moves can trigger edit wars, break links and cause a lot of problems. Please stop unilaterally moving pages, as you did with Kim Jong-il, and follow the correct procedure.     I gather English may not be your native language; article names should match common usage in English, and not (for instance) a transliteration of the Russian version.

Block

I have reverted nationalist anti-Soviet propaganda, mass deletion and removing the mention of Nazi collaborationist war crimes in Participants in World War II about once a day. I have been blocked in circumvent of the rules by a POV admin. The article should be restored to the pre-edit war status

Nixer, you reverted that article four times. I have blocked you for only 24 hours, although your repeated 3RR violations would usually warrant more, as would your """"POV admin"""" remark above.  (T) 

Taking no position whether Nixer  deserves a block for revert warring, I must note that 4 reverts accumulated in 36, not 24 hours as per this. Staying under 3RR is no entitlement in any way and general revert warring is subject to admin's discretion blocks. However, in such case the admin should be uninvolved, unlike user:ProhibitOnions who was one of the editors who reverted Nixer. Again, I take no position on whether Nixer should be blocked for RV warring in general, just noting that technically 3RR is not there and blocking by admin who participates in article disagreement is highly inappropriate in such case.

All this aside, Nixer, you should cool down finally.  

Three of Nixer's reverts were within 24 hours and the fourth was the following morning, which I reverted, but subsequently restored. Furthermore, I am not a recent editor of this article, and am not thrilled by the attitude presented by either Nixer or the editors reverted; if there had been any genuine discussion, they might have been able to reach a compromise, as they were both presenting opposing national",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Felice Beato 
Thanks for your message. I am delighted, that you are pleased that it got translated into German. By the way, I - naturally - checked some literature as well, although not so extensively as you obviously have. To my literature, a large encoclypedia on the history of photography, Felice Beato got naturalised as a British person in the 1860s. I probably will change the now translated text to that as I regard this encyclopedia as pretty trustfull.

Anyway, I really enjoyed translating your article, because I liked your article quite a lot  and as I can see from the George Psalmanazar International Appreciation Society I am not the only one. Right at the moment the article is in the """"Review process"""" and hopefully attract somebody to check my sometimes not so very good spelling and german grammar (it always gets even more awfull if I translate something). And afterwards it will run for the german equivalent of the """"Featured articles"""" - although in the german wikipedia the standards there are rather high, I am right at the moment pretty confident that we make it.

In ictu oculi
As has been explained, """"POVfork"""" is one of the ritual phrases you incant on this page; because it defies reality, it is an excuse to avoid meaningful discourse, rather than an attempt at achieving it. If you mean something else, which you likely do, then use words that are accurate and express your meaning, rather than obsessively repeating obviously false statements.
As has also been explained, repeating long lists of last names, without any context (e.g. """"Voorst, Horbury, Schafer, Berger, Maier, Meier, Theissen, Klausner, Rubenstein, Boyarin, Teppler, Stanton & Stroumsa, Kessler, Sanders, Neusner"""") are also ritual behaviors that have little semantic content. You have been challenged to produce actual citations, which would include book names, author, year, page number, and relevant quotations. You continually refuse or fail to do so.
When you finally produce a citation that more-or-less complies with WP:CITE (albeit with completely idiosyncratic formatting), you still get it wrong. For example, you just now added what you describe as """"Quarles (2008)"""". In fact, the reference is Bauckham (2008): I know this because I added it myself three weeks ago! Not only that, the material you added was already present in the article, in the very section in which I added the citation! If you do not read the article, then how can you comment on its contents, much less attempt to edit them?
I have kept your Voorst citation, and again, put it where it belongs. For the longest time, the lede had the sentence """"There are some modern scholars who understand these passages to be references to Christianity and the Christian figure of Jesus"""", with the citation Such as Dalman This reference, of course, is one of your infamous """"last name only"""" citations, which completely fail WP:CITE. Rather than replace it with Voorst, who makes the same point, and is a century newer, you oddly repeat the material in a second sentence. There is no rational explanation for doing this that I can see.
We absolutely do have a neutral first sentence in the lede, despite your best attempts to the contrary - that was the clear consensus of the RFC above. You fixation on the claim that Yeshu does not refer to an individual or individuals leaves you in a very difficult spot. It has been your on-going contention that the name """"Yeshu"""" is merely the name used by rabbis for Jesus. However, when you insist that """"Yeshu"""" does not refer to an individual, or demand proof that it does, what you are also demanding is proof that """"Jesus"""" refers to an individual, since it is you that insists """"Yeshu""""=""""Jesus"""". Do you not believe Jesus was and indivudal? Are you promoting, then, the Jesus myth theory?
I am doing my best still to assume good faith here; unfortunately, to do so, I am forced to come to the conclusion that the issue with your edits and comments here is one of competence. I am now very strongly encouraging you to propose changes here, accurately citing the reliable sources you would like to use to support those edits.

The issue of the controversy was not about what was omitted, but what some historians claim was a deliberate distortion of President Johnson's attitude and role.

 Homosexuality 

Sorry to overrule a point, but there is no creditable way to suggest that Richard was not homosexual, despite the fact that  the category 'homosexual' did not exist in the middle ages.  He had sex with men, many times, and showed almost no interest in women.  Any respectable biography will say the same.  I felt it was important to make this point, and have changed a sentence or two to reflect this, but not made a large deal out of it  (for instance, not created a separate section). -Ft Louie

This is, IMO, a good point. There were a couple of lines devoted to this, as well as King Rick's inclusion in the GLBTQ article category, which were reverted by an anon as 'anon vandalism' (bizarre, no?). This should be restored, as there is at least excellent anecdotal evidence that Richard did indeed have a predominating interest in men.  16:39, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)

Again, Richard being a bisexual or gay, met a person in denial (or person in some other way disturbed by the fact that there have been non-heterosexuals also in history as well as there are today), who on 29.5.2005 vandalized this article by removals. This time, the vandal used the username Alphax. As above indicated, previous similar vandal attempts occurred in March 2005 and December 2004. Hopefully the vandal or vandals are enjoined from such future activity.  

Alphax wasn't vandalizing, don't be ridiculous. He was removing what appears to be extreme speculation, written in poor English. You make a number of claims that would benefit from a source - where does Richard confess to being homosexual? Note also that the IP you were using to add the material the first time also added similar nonsense to Humphrey and Isabella's articles, including """"Category:Faghags"""" to Isabella.  

I think you Adam should not be ridiculous. If you look carefully at the edit history of this article, you see that most of those texts were added by other editors months ago. And you have the basic reference: the biographer mentioned by that editor and listed in the references, obviously has answered your question. Please read it (I haven't - I trust on the previous editor - and I have not time to seek all books). 

As to Alphax, since that person clearly did not read this talk page, nor offered here the reasons for removal, before removals, it is regarded as act of vandalism.  

I removed the stuff because it was badly written, lacked references,, and was there was a link to a website that attempted to """"prove"""" the claims, also without references.  τεχ 08:10, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)

The problem with Richard's alleged homosexuality is that no one, not a single primary or secondary source, from Richard's time unti WWII, ever mentioned that Richard liked men; in fact, he was often cited for his abnormal lust for women.    The contrary view first appeared in """"The Plantagenets"""" by J.H. Harvey in 1949.  The theory remains highly controversial and, to be honest, viewed with some skepticism by the mainstream academic world.  It is a theory worth stating in the article, but it should be noted that there remains serious discussion on whether or not it's true.   

Well to be honest, you can simply remove that part entirely if you want. 62.78 seems to have moved on to other articles, and I know I've removed his nonsense from a number of other articles with no further reaction from him.  

I think one of the arguments for it is his lack of offspring, legitimate or otherwise: one illegitimate child, if I recall correctly. But a bout of mumps or other infection could have curtailed his fertility. Or perhaps he was the ungenerous sort who didn't acknowledge his illegitimate kids.  

The book Warriors of God is an excellent portrayal of King Richard's life, including his homosexual relationship with the King of France.

I'll be frank.  The blocking of  came a bit late for my taste.  However, he was found to be in violation of the 3 revert rule, and to again quote the policy which ironically Malke was threatening people with and was himself found to be in violation of:

"""" A bright line exists on edit warring, known as the three-revert rule (3RR). If an administrator has not acted already by this point, then action is very likely, especially if a report is made to the noticeboard. Policy forbids edit warring generally, and editors may be blocked if they edit war, with or without breaching 3RR. """"

I commend  for taking the actions he did.  The subsequent complaints Malke made, and his promise to cease his activity in order to get unblocked a few days later, are a matter of record on his user talk page.  Malke has since deleted the notifications, but they are viewable in his talk page history, and make interesting reading.

After Malke's block on August 19, 2009, I decided I needed to take a step back.  For the past ten days I have busied myself with other Wikipedia subjects.  I now return to this page.  I suggest we talk a bit about what happened, and I also suggest we take a look at what happened here this month, edit by edit.  It continues to seem clear to me that Malke was editing with obsession towards an agenda; his obsession got him in hot water with the admins.  Soon, Wikipedia policy is going to change, as many here know.  I'd welcome some reasonable discussion, and renewed work on the article.   

On closer examination of the history pages of the main article, it appears some of Malke's biased edits, through sheer volume, are still in effect.  I propose going through every edit of his, see exactly what changes of his have survived, and put back all relevant, sourced material.  Once that is effected, we can pick up the chore of dealing with further improvements.   

Having just returned to WP from an extended absence, I am not fully familiar with what has occurred with this article, but cursory skimming of the talk page reminds me of some of the frustrations which led me to leave WP more than a year ago. I recognize Malke's concerns. Material that is added back should strictly follow WP:BLP, ie., it should be directly relevant to Rove, not defamatory, and should be sourced by reliable secondary sources.   

Malke's concerns were one thing, his methods another.  Admins blocked him not only due to his violation of the three edit rule, but because he was deleting paragraphs of properly sourced material, and as the admins noted (to quote directly from Malke's talk page history, since he has since, for obvious reasons, deleted all reference to his blocking):

   
   
- *An impartial administrator just did; I don't know you from Adam, and haven't so much as looked at the contents of your edits; all that matters is that you broke WP:3RR, and received a short block for it; if you want to be unblocked, all you have to do is agree to stop edit warring, regardless of whether you think it is justified or not. :==( o )

8a29e8d560db3319,""":It's a college town, and to my knowledge there is nothing there that would make it a wartime target. Knowning that Lawrence was hit changes a lot, though; before Gray's report, I think the general assumption was that only the real big cities were hit. If Lawrence was hit, though, that means a hundred other smaller cities across the U.S. could also have been targets.
Not to launch into too much speculation here, but that opens up some interesting possibilities. If the people of Jericho could see a mushroom cloud over Denver, then they would surely see one over Colorado Springs (the home of NORAD) and Pueblo. Wichita (which is about as far from Jericho as Denver is) might also have been a target, since its population is more than three times that of Lawrence. As has been mentioned before, Denver is not visible from western Colorado (nor are there any real mountains anywhere in the vicinity). If the bad guys unleashed Tsar Bomba upon the city of Denver, then maybe, but Gray said the NYC bomb they intercepted was only 20 kilotons.
A possible answer to this is that the mushroom cloud seen in the first episode could have been over one of the smaller cities closer to the Kansas border, say Limon or Sterling. There are no towns between Denver and Kansas that have a population of more than fifty or sixty thousand. But if Lawrence was hit....

Hi Howard and all the rest of you guys Americans or d'ailleurs,

I favor Howard's proposal of having an article to list all of the third-party participants in the Iran-Iraq War, not just a separate article for U.S.

I was kidding when I said that adding U.S. to both sides would fix the infobox, but not kidding in the sense that if someone sticks U.S. in one side, the history shows U.S. should be in both sides.

I am inclusionist with respect to the infobox and think that anybody who moved arms to either side should be included.  

All of this is hashed out ad naseum above but the new Iranian guy has kicked it all off again by throwing U.S. into the info box once again bringing us back into the grand and glorious infobox debate territory.

Also there are two other guys (C-Suit and B-Louie) going into endless debates about a single Iranian war slogan (something like """"Onward, beans and bagels, fight fight fight for Palestine"""" or something like that) that one insists is real and the other insists is invented but I can't for the life of me figure out why either of them considers it worthy of so much debate.  Oh yes, the slogan is """"We will keep fighting until we win"""".  You'd hope so, don't you think?  What else would they say, """"We will keep fighting until we stop fighting or whatever""""?  That would not be a very effective slogan!

Is there some way we can combine the slogan debate and the infobox debate into one huge bonfire of nitpicking?

I'd like that!

Contradiction between sources

I cannot access the text and would like to see it. I also think picking 1840 is arbitrary.  This source which provides a population table for Jerusalem from 1806 - 1945 on page 28 indicates that in 1838 the population was 11,500 people (4,500 Muslims, 3,500 Christians, and 3,000 Jews); in 1846 the population was 17,173 (6,100 Muslims, 3,558 Christians, and 7,515 Jews) and that in 1851 it was 25,354 (12,286 Muslims, 7,488 Christians, and 5,580 Jews). Given the city had become an important administrative capital for the Ottoman empire in the 19th century, its not suprising that there were new arrivals all the time from all three religious groups.

 More useful info 
A voice chat session was conducted soon after the episode 7 release, during which the pure pwnage crew answered questions from fans around the globe. There was quite a bit of interesting info to gain from listening to recordings of the chat session. Some of this info should probably be worked into the article here. One such recording is currently at http://chigau.com/ppchat-edited.mp3 Another artifact related to the show would be Anastasia's blog. However, I cannot ascertain the true nature of this blog (whether it's Anastasia's 'real' blog, or just a prop set up for the show). Despite the fact that it is claimed to be the real blog, during the chat session mentioned above, I find it hard to believe the claim, due to the language used throughout the blog itself.

 You can bet your life it's not real ;-) 
 The fact that the blog mentions Jeremy being put in the hospital for playing WoW is an obvious give away that the blog is purely fictional.  02:07, August 20, 2005 (UTC)
 Don't be so sure. That's how I felt until I started looking around a bit more. Listen to the chat, read the blog, browse some of their forums. Now I'm not so sure. Considering that the blog starts before the sixth episode it seems pretty real and the way they keep mentioning on the forums that when they have PP meets people can't belive how close to the truth the show is. 
 It's fiction, partly based on real life. Come on, if you think PP is really happening watch the 9th episode.
-someonelse: well actually, i agree with aupajo. I'm not saying that people can shoot micro, or that  dave used to be some kind of micro warrior, but its possible that the crew used to act like they do in the first couple episodes, and changed their ways.

 Reviews of Pure Pwnage 

 by Anonymous (67.140.145.26) Essentially Jeremy embodies the very scum of online gaming in a package that is all too familiar.  Pathetic vocabulary skills, general lack of anything resembling cultural knowledge, and the lifestyle of the perpetual slacker round out the package nicely.  This is, unfortunately, what most people think of when you say 'gamer' unless you're talking about the pen and paper variety, which has it's own features (among them, the thankful lacking of the word """"n00b"""") that set it apart.  All in all I think this is a good parody of the gamer lifestyle, but unfortunately the misguided masses of preteens will attempt to emulate it further than they do on their own.  Online gaming is bad enough these days without stirring up that particular cesspool any more than needed.  In the end, it makes me yearn for the days of my youth when Quake's seperate online client was released.  Those were days when people would actually have intelligent conversation until the server filled up enough for a good game of CTF. (and that was before there even WAS a flag... it was a key)  Now, it's all n00b fagz0rz l0ll0rz!!!11!!!1one and corpse humping until you get bored and leave.  I can only hope that this scathing satire of that type of behavior will help show new gamers how NOT to act.

and what, may i ask, does this pov have to do with wikipedia?

Why Korean comfort women?

Why Korean comfort women during Korean War and why Korean collaborators? Because it is true. It all happened and it was all discuss probably before you were born. So we look to the academics and newspapers for reference.

From, The Construction of US Camptown Prostitution in South Korea: Transformation and Resistance by Lee, Na Young, 2006
 
'The term “comfort women” (wianbu) to refer to military prostitutes serving American soldiers signals the widespread acceptance of camptown prostitution as an inevitable means to entertain foreign soldiers. This term was commonly used in newspaper articles throughout the 1950s along with such phrases as “prostitutes catering to UN soldiers” and terms like yanggongju (Western princesses), or “UN madams” (woman getting a livelihood by serving UN soldiers).129 This usage continued during the 1960s and 1970s when camptown prostitution became more differentiated from non-U.S. military prostitution.  The Korean government’s policy on prostitution reflected its public’s perspectives on prostitution, which was, in the decades after the war, regarded as a necessary means to feed Korea’s impoverished population.'

The Chosun Ilbo or Daily News is major newspapers in South Korea 2,200,000 readers. Examples given are in Chosun Ilbo 23 August, 1960, it mentions, """"In Pup’yLng, some 150 'comfort women dealing with American troops'. Similar reports using the words """"comfort women"""" are: KyLnghyang Ilbo, 11/25/1955; Chosun ilbo, 11/08/1957; Chosun ilbo, 8/23/1960; Chosun ilbo, 12/03/1963. A “Comfort Women’s demonstration” is also reported in 1966. 

In the mid- to late-1960s, there were numerous articles in Chosun ilbo reporting crimes committed against camptown prostitutes by American soldiers that continued to used the term 'comfort women'. Korea college girls recruited for the Nangnang Club were also viewed as """"yanggongju"""" or comfort women (Seoul Sinmun 26 July, 1952; 10 October, 1953). Post-war military brothels were still known as comfort stations and the system based on the Japanese one.

In 1958, the Chosun ilbo also accounts for the number of women involved as 300,000. The women who served “one American husband” were called “yangbuin” (Western madam) instead of the usual """"yanggalbo"""" (western whore) who were generally treated by Korean society as “non-human beings”. Generally, the Yanggongju have been ignored in official Korean histories as a national shame until recent. 

Song-gun Chong in 1967 wrote, 3,000 so-called “comfort women” registered with the  Health Section of the Military and the Military Police Corps of the U.S. Army (“Current Situations of Korean Prostitutes and Countermeasures.” Pophak-nonchong 8:65-87.)

He is now mostly retired and owns a small company, Bear Mountain Scientific, that he uses to fulfill various types of writing contracts. His company web site is BearMountainScientific.com.
Publications: Vernon R. Harris has published three books as of August, 2009. They are:
The Travelers - The Travelers, is a fiction story about a couple, Ray and Sue Barker, visiting a new town during a vacation where they met a very unusual couple one day. The couple they met is referred to as “The Travelers,” and their names were Carl and Collie. Ray and Sue visited with The Travelers for a while and even had lunch with them. What they learned about The Travelers and their backgrounds left Ray and Sue almost speechless. This is the story about the Travelers and their strange tales. It is a story of visitors or travelers from another planet but with a totally different twist. Those readers of the Christian faith will find this story especially interesting. Those readers who are science buffs or scientists will find this story very intriguing. Is the story of The Travelers possibly real, and not just fiction? Listen to the facts as they unfold, and you decide. ISBN:  978-1-61582-414-4

The Cats of Coward County - The Cats of Coward County is a fictional story about a scientific experiment that accidentally resulted in a group of cats developing some human like characteristics. Since they were cats first, their cat personality was dominate but they were able to develop new skills, and memories, and, they could talk. These are some of the humorous stories involved with this group of cats that try so hard to organize and develop their own little town, a town called """"Cat City.” The personality and humorous antics of each cat living in Cat City comes to life as the stories unfold. Mouser, a real cat, is fictionalized as the Father of Cat City and is recognized as the Mayor of the town and attempts to guide the other cats in the development of their town and solving it's many problems. The many stories are filled with humor showing how the cats dealt with their new found thoughts that are filled with both human and cat memories. You will be introduced to Cat City, how it got started, what it looks like, and how the cats make it work for them. You will get to know Vern and Pam who helped the cats get their town started and how they helped the cats organize all the different parts of their town. Vern and Pam, who lived close by, got involved only when it was absolutely necessary. We hope you enjoy meeting all the cats. The Cats of Coward County is designed to add a new perspective to your imagination and a sense of humor and how cats might evolve in these circumstances. ISBN: 978-1-61582-406-9

Sweet Water Canyon - Sweet Water Canyon is a fictional story about the trek of a group of pioneers crossing the country in 1859 from a Midwestern town and going west. They traveled together in a wagon train. Dozens of wagon trains had already made it across the country and had pretty well marked the way, if there is such a thing, for those that followed. They traveled by wagon train because the promised railroad going from east to west was far behind schedule and seemed like a distant, hope. It describes one type of hardship and danger the early pioneers had to endure. This is the story of one part of one journey and the impact it had on the entire wagon train. Readers of the Christian faith will find this story especially interesting. ISBN: 978-1-61582-405-2

   Thanks for taking the time to explain Gbawden.  I posted this response to Tokyogirl79 and have also posted here for you.  I would also like to request your assistance in gathering and presenting the materials for Wikipedia entries as outlined below.  

I have no affiliation with The Resonance Project aside from Nassim Haramein's lectures giving some validation to ideas I have been thinking about for a long time, but for which it has been hard to find reliable information about. At times the subject seems to have been suppressed by the science establishment either purposefully or just out of hubris, and anyone discussing the subject publicly ridiculed.  Either way it's """"flat-earth society"""" type behaviour that I find objectionable.

I understand your points but disagree, particularly on the notability aspect.  I can easily find scores of entries regarding subjects of less notability than The Resonance Project on Wikipedia.  I am suspicious of the motivation to so quickly suppress my expression of free speech in this so called """"community"""".  Instead of offering a chance for me to bring my article into compliance with Wikipedia standards you quickly deleted it, and by doing so silenced my opinions.  Thats wrong.  And although a comment made by another editor stated that I had a chance to contest the """"Speedy Deletion"""" I could find no such option.

When you have notability thresholds for a supposedly public community which rely on mainstream media to set the bar, and the mainstream media is owned and virtually controlled by a few select individuals and organizations with their own agendas, then you have a problem.  Wikipedia you have a problem, and if I can't get entries for """"Nassim Haramein"""" and """"The Resonance Project"""" in I am going to begin a campaign to discredit and inform of the corruption of Wikipedia, the not-so-""""free"""" encyclopedia. (or really just add my voice to the growing dissent that is out there already).  Wake up  Wikipedia editors...open your eyes and minds and be a force for good in the world, not another puppet.

This new field of spiritual science or Unified Physics, whatever you want to call it, is an important subject and needs to be represented in the sphere of social consciousness whether you agree with it or not.  There are thriving social media communities of 300,000+ individuals on both The Resonance Project and Hassim Harramein's Facebook pages, and yet Wikipedia via it's ignorant (sorry it's true) editors quickly dismiss as not notable.  It's notable enough for 300,000 people to include the information provided by Nassim Haramein and The Resonance Project in their social media feeds, who are you to dismiss so many people's opinions?  300,000 people think about that.

If I gather the neccessary information would you be willing to help me organize it in such a manner as to pass muster of the Wikipedia editorial drones?

Footprints, also known as Footprints in the Sand, is a popular allegorical text written in prose. Although released as an """"anonymous contribution"""", it is often mistakenly attributed to Mary Stevenson or Margaret Fishback Powers. Carolyn Joyce Carty is the only author of the most popular version known as Footprints poem; One night a man had a dream whose copyright actually reflects it's anonymous contribution of authorship. See U.S. Copyright Record. 

There also seems to be a critical error when stating that neithr Ella Scharring Hausen or Mary Stevenson never claimed their own copyright that it was only claimed for them by others. What kind of nonsense is that? Mary Stevenson vicariously tried to claim authorship of Hausens public domain version.

The underlying reason for this is to protect the treasury from potential large losses in tax revenue. Significantly, alternatives such as energy efficiency initiatives, home based micro-generation and solar thermal power installations would reduce VAT revenue from energy bills.

Hi Peter.  I'm not an admin, but I do a fair amount of quality-control on Wikipedia - you've might have spotted 1 or 2 warnings I've issued in the past.  We both know the system usually works very well, provided users are given fair and appropriate, escalating warnings, eventually being reported if they continue.  

But it seems it can happen that the odd user is harder to rein in.  Such is the case I fear with  this user - would you say I've given them sufficient, clear warnings?  

However, to my surprise, when   I duly reported them, a single overseer apparently dismissed all my concerns in short shrift.

The reason that you were cautioned about your behaviour on the Anita Sarkeesian talkpage is that you were using the space, not to propose improvements to the page, but to criticise the person that it's about. Wikipedia takes this very seriously because the whole site can be found responsible for things that editors like you and I say, even if it's not in article space. For this reason, biographies of living people are taken very seriously, and come under the most scrutiny of any Wikipedia articles. Here is the appropriate policy, it's vital that you read it if you want to edit articles about living people.

With regard to the Anita Sarkeesian article, if there are specific additions that you want to make to it, please suggest those on the talkpage. """"She's a liar"""" is insufficient, you need to find a notable source whose content you want to add. This policy details how we determine what sources are notable.

At the end of the day, though, whatever you believe, Wikipedia is going to describe the positions and opinions of a lot of people you disagree with. That doesn't mean that Wikipedia endorses those points of view, simply that they are notable people whose statements and actions are worth documenting here. At least until you get a bit of experience, I strongly recommend you stick to uncontroversial topics, or BLPs of people whom you agree with.  

You must clearly be blind take a second look at the very top of this page and you'll see a link to libel on it.

Rather a comb was and is an important article of everyday use. There are no articles on horn combs which were used before plastics on Wikipedia and I was only trying to fill a gap by writing a article and improving on horn combs about what we used before plastics.

In addition, James Miles states: """"The rioting seemed primarily an eruption of ethnic hatred."""",which I'm guessing he had to interview many rioters/residents to ask them about it. And rather, I don't think the Rodney King article is worded very well- it should be changed, but I'm guessing many people are already well-informed of the real reasons for those riots, unlike this riot where few seem to understand- including you! And, come on now, you're obviously just picking at straws to try to twist the article. All evidence so far points to the rioters looting and beating ethnic Han chinese out of hatred, not because they want to separate or they would've attacked much more government buildings rathern than focussing on the stores of more wealthy Chinese people. Right now, the article is pretty neutral as it already explains both sides and I hope people keep it this way.216.252.71.154

 Analysts concluded that Georgian Buk missile systems were responsible for downing four Russian aircraft—three Sukhoi Su-25 close air support aircraft and a Tupolev Tu-22M strategic bomber—in the 2008 South Ossetia war. U.S. officials have said Georgia's SA-11 Buk-1M was certainly the cause of the Tu-22M's loss and contributed to the losses of the three Su-25s.Georgian Military Folds Under Russian Attack By David A.

Dear Mr McLaughlin,

With regards to your persistent efforts of keeping the old spelling of the capital of Ukraine. For your information:

 It is spelled as Kyiv in English language because:
 1) Ukrainian government insists on Kyiv spelling
 2) The State Department of the U.S. issued a directive to write Kyiv
 3) The Prime Minister of the U.K. calls the city Kyiv - http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page20199
 4) United Nations Multilingual Terminology Database (the ultimate body on geographical names) approved it as Kyiv - http://unterm.un.org/dgaacs/unterm.nsf/WebView/B57BF6AB5F06749B85256DC700440AAD?OpenDocument
 5) Major English speaking governments worldwide switched to Kyiv spelling
 6) CIA refers to the city as Kyiv - https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/up.html
 7) The name of the famous football club is Dynamo Kyiv (recognised worldwide)
 8) Many papers, e.g., British The Guardian, are already writing Kyiv
 9) All major Canadian media already use the spelling of Kyiv
 10) and many more reasons and references on http://kyiv.of-cour.se/

If we only listen to your arguments, we would be also correcting Almaty to Alma-Ata. However, it is Almaty and Kyiv it is of course. Above you have had enough of proofs and strong arguments of usage of the name Kyiv in the modern English language, so it is time to catch up and finally fix the name to Kyiv.

I cant help it if you are blind & have ZERO attention to details. the image you replaced at Surat Railway Station is wrong for 4 very simple reason's which are somehow beyond your ability to understand simple things. So once again, i have to explain it to you like a kid with limited understanding.
1. The same image is on the Mumbai Rajdhani Page as being at Mumbai Central station. So unless you have come up with a miracle that converts Mumbai into Surat,you are wrong.
2. The image has been taken in bright sun light. 12951 Rajdhani Express arrives at Surat between 1937-1942 hrs so unless you have come up with another miracle & ensured bright sunlight at that time. Daylight may exist but not of such intensity.
3.If you would have ever visited Surat railway station, you would know that the layout of the station is very different from what the image claims.
4.The building in the background is far taller than what buildings in Surat are. Take a ride in the local trains of Mumbai & you may be able to see the same building there but in your case i have my doubts.

 I agree. I have had a small amount of time this evening to do a little research. This 2010 review  could perhaps help in bridging the void. It states that there is a """"lack of consensus"""" and """"robust evidence"""" within the medical literature for things such as penile cancer, STI and UTI, while maintaining there is evidence for HIV prevention (at least in the African trials). If I had the time I would be tempted to run a statistical analysis on the medical reviews themselves! I suspect there would be a clear correlation betweeen the conclusions reached and the country from which they originated. Which brings us (in my opinion) to the crux of the matter. Rightly or wrongly, this is primarily a ritualistic or cosmetic procedure, regardless of what evidence or opinion the medical community has, or will provide. Therefore, to treat this as almost an entirely statistically based article, while only giving a cursory nod to the ethical debate, just feels wrong to me. I am certainly not advocating any bias either for or against. I would be happy to see quotes from Rabbis, Imams, surgeons and scholars. I also believe that any medical consensus (if proven) should remain the basis of the article. Perhaps a sub-heading of """"controversy"""" may be worthwhile? """,0,0,0,0,0,0

If anything, it's helped to clarify that xxxHolic and XXXHolic appear to be the only two names with enough consensus to move to either. It's also shown that twice (atm 8 vs. 4) as many people support xxxHolic over XXXholic, the initially proposed namespace by Cyrus XIII which had 9 supports, and that only one (atm) person supports the current title of ×××HOLiC when there were 7 votes against a move in the previous proposal.

Pechenegs had been driven out of their homeland by the Cumans and settled in Northern Bulgaria since some years, they raided and invaded Byzantine Thrace with their families and intended to settle at the Maritza river,[1]

But at the Battle of Levounion 1091 the Pechenegs were attacked by a combined army of Byzantines with Cuman mercenaries, the Pechenegs were almost totally killed, soldiers and civilians, this battled nearly annihilated the Pecheneg people. Later the survivors were massacred in the Battle of Beroia. (This is clearly ethnic cleansing, even if they were a newly migrated people to the Balkans.) 

I added:
At the Battle of Levounion (1091), the Pecheneg, a nomadic Turkic people from the Pontic-Caspian steppe, were nearly wiped out by the sedentary Byzantine Greeks and nomadic Cumans.{{cite book|last=Agbedo|first=Chris|title=Problems of multilingual nations  the Nigerian perspective|year=2007|publisher=Fidgina Global Books|location=Enugu, Nigeria|isbn=9789788132844|page=89|url=http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&hl;=nl&q;=ethnic+cleansing+greeks+pechenegs&btnG;=#hl=nl&tbm;=bks&sclient;=psy-ab&q;=The+Pechenegs%2C+nomadic+Turkic+peop-o+from+the+steppe%2C+were+nearly+annihilated+at+the+Battle+of+Levounion+by+a+combined+Byzantine+and+Cuman+army+in+1091.&oq;=The+Pechenegs%2C+nomadic+Turkic+peop-o+from+the+steppe%2C+were+nearly+annihilated+at+the+Battle+of+Levounion+by+a+combined+Byzantine+and+Cuman+army+in+1091.&gs;_l=serp.12...21850.21850.3.22808.1.1.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0...0.1...1c..15.psy-ab.NHxON2jEZfU&pbx;=1&bav;=on.2,or.r_qf.&bvm;=bv.47244034,d.d2k&fp;=1f7c60039cb2be7d&biw;=1438&bih;=647

Original sentence was: The Pechenegs, nomadic Turkic people from the steppe, were nearly annihilated at the Battle of Levounion by a combined Byzantine and Cuman army in 1091.

I changed this into  At the Battle of Levounion (1091), the Pecheneg, a nomadic Turkic people from the Pontic-Caspian steppe, were nearly wiped out by the sedentary Byzantine Greeks and nomadic Cumans.

Manzikert Anatolia
This was added from the same book: After the Battle of Manzikert (1071), Greek populations of Anatolia were ethnically cleansed by nomadic Seljuk Turks

But the original sentence in the book was:[1]
The ethnic cleansing of sedentary Greek population of Anatolia by nomadic Seljuk Turks after the Battle of Manzikert in 1071.

If Levounion is copyright violation than this is also.

The idea that Seljuk Turks ethnically cleansed Anatolia is not true, Anatolian Greek populations survived till 1922, the Population exchange between Greece and Turkey.

Claiming Seljuks ethnically cleansed Anatolia is historically incorrect, it had a multicultural population, besides Seljuks had a sedentary state Seljuk Empire,  besides this claim was based upon one source, which was added by cherry picking and snippet abuse.

Why have you changed the image again? The text is now all but unreadable. It is now forced into single-word lines, extending down past the reference section. ,It looks ridiculous. You quoted IMGSIZE, yet again, in the summary. That policy states:
 In general, do not use px without very good reason

What that means is, the policy needs not to be unilaterally enforced at all costs. If, as in this instance, there is a need for a change in size, it is permissible. The policy further states:
Where px is used, the resulting image should be no more than 500 pixels tall and no more than 400 pixels wide, for comfortable display on the smallest devices in common use.

I have already (and repeatedly) demonstrated that upsizing to 250px is all that required. (I bet even 220px would work). That is well within the limits. The change to the picture itself is negligible, and therefore does not impact the article negatively in any way. It only servers to benefit the article by making the text within the caption more wieldy and easier to read. It also eliminates the impact of needlessly extending the picture frame all the way down to the refs.

Surely you can see this. Since you're quoting this policy so much, surely you know that it does not prohibit this edit. I have asked repeatedly that you look at the effect on the article, both before and after the edit, and in doing so,. surely you see the need for this edit.

The only notable features of the Sherman was that it was produced in large quantities, had a mechanical reliability that beat the T-34, and came with better secondary equipment such as FM Radio and an elevation gyro-stabiliser.

b9022813bdf238d5,"""== Discussing recombination ==

Recently I noticed that this article uses 'genetic recombination' to refer to recombination that occurs during in meiosis and brings about genetic diversity among organisms.  This isn't necessarily correct: genetic recombination can also refer to non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or V(D)J recombination, neither of which, to my knowledge, occur during meiosis or produce heritable genetic diversity among organisms.  To account for that, I think it would be helpful to replace instances of 'genetic recombination' with 'homologous recombination', the type of genetic recombination to which this article refers.  What are others' thoughts on this?  The only drawback I could see would be the slightly less reader-friendly word 'homologous'. This, however, seems clarified by the first sentence in the 'Sex and recombination' section to invoke the phrase: """"In the related process of genetic recombination, sexual organisms can also exchange DNA between two matching chromosomes.""""  If the inaccessibility of the word 'homologous' were in fact a drawback, I think it would be more than compensated for by the greater accuracy of the information being presented to the reader.

Yesterday I tried introducing this change, but was reverted.  In the summary of that reversion, the editor noted: """"why be less general? homologous excludes translocations, duplications, fusions, etc.""""  I've offered my rationale for being specific just above, but was curious about the second sentence.  If homologous recombination excludes translocations, duplications, fusions, etc., then is that somehow accounted for by other types of genetic recombination, like NHEJ or V(D)J recombanation?  To my understanding, it is a failure of homologous recombination in meiosis that produces heritable chromosome translocations, fusions, and gene duplications.    

I think you are correct, being more accurate is better since the sentence does refer specifically to matching chromosomes. I've reworded this to state In a related process called homologous recombination, sexual organisms exchange DNA between two matching chromosomes. I've added the idea of general recombination to the previous section, adding Mutations can involve large sections of DNA becoming duplicated, usually through genetic recombination.   

 Charles Darwin film 'too controversial for religious America' 

""""A British film about Charles Darwin has failed to find a US distributor because his theory of evolution is too controversial for American audiences, according to its producer.""""    

That's a laugh. Please don't try to make evolution look like it's a helpless victim being attacked by a bunch of religious nuts. The theory of evolution does have many loopholes, but America is not religious by any means; I'm shocked that an American producer turned down the film. —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs) 

Sorry, I just don't see how evolution can be a controversial topic - evolution is all around us, simple as that. People who tend to object to such basic fundamental facts of life tends not to understand the depth of the topic to the point of understanding it, but rather the shallow aspect to justify their lack of understanding. Not everyone is good at science so some people would tend to take the shallow route of critizing something if they don't understand. Example; I'm terrible at pre-calculus so I critize the aspect of pre-calculus to justify my understanding - see where I'm getting at?

 Death 

It's being reported that Peter Jennings died tonight. Should the article be updated now, or pending confirmation?  

Confirmed by ABC News.  

May he rest in peace.  23:54, August 8, 2005 (UTC)

I'm currently watching (live) """"World News Tonight With Peter Jennings"""" yet he died two days ago. Why is that?

Charles Gibson noted, near the end of the Monday cast, that it would remain """"World News Tonight with Peter Jennings"""" for the forseeable future; possibly until they've named a replacement, which will be a while.

Consistent with this article, from the NYT archives, I am changing all references to Jennings' solo anchor duties to beginning on August 9, 1983.  
 

 Chuck Jones death 

But, the only thing Peter Jennings did not do was to report the death of the animator, Chuck Jones in 2002 by ignoring the report.  Does anyone know about this?

 What? 

""""Preceded by:
new show""""
I have no idea what this means, does anyone, it looks odd 

It means, there wasn't a CTV National News before then.   

Doesn't make sense

The article says:
""""Jennings also attended Carleton University, University of Ottawa, and Rider College in New Jersey. He never graduated from high school or college.""""

How is that possible? He attended universities but never graduated Highschool..

Trust me, as someone with a chequered educational career, I can affirm that it is possible to get into college without a diploma. Many post secondary institutions have 'special student' part time or night school programs with relaxed entrance requirements. Of course, it helps that his dad was a bigwig at the CBC.  

I am an alumni of Carleton, until recently,  if one was out of school for a couple of years you could sign up as a """"special Student"""" and if you did well in a couple of courses, you could then apply as a """"Mature Student"""" with no consideration of your previous education required.",0,0,0,0,0,0

You *ARE* indeed clueless. Yes, """"Ariana"""" is a different spelling for """"Aryana"""" which does indeed come from the Avestan's """"Aryanem Vaejo"""" (specifically, in Vandidad, Fargasht-e Yekom).  But the """"Aria"""" that you mention above is Greek for what is in Old Persian """"Haraiva"""" which is modern Herat (Hari-Rud).  Looks like you can't even read and understand a simple text in front of you.  The Greek """"Aria"""" has NOTHING TO DO with """"Arianem Vaejo"""".  Not even a single scholar has ever suggested that Arianem Vaejo is the same as """"Haraivo or the Greek """"Aria"""".  The Greek """"Aria"""" for Avestan/Old Persian """"Haraivo"""" is comparable to how in ancient greek text Hagmatana is written """"Ekbatana"""" or many other examples. The Old Persian satapry Hari-Rud (which was not called Hari-Rud in Old Persian) is clearly mentioned in both Darius I's Behistun Inscription as well as two of Xerxes' inscriptions.  """"Arianem Vaejo"""" on the other hand, is mentioned in the Avesta where I told you above, and numerous scholars have published works on the whereabouts of it (including our own late Dr. Bahram Farahvashi who has a full book by that title, called """"Iran Vij"""").  Nobody (other than our great scholar """"Zereshk"""" of course) thinks it is the same as Hari-Rud/Haraivo/greek """"Aria"""".  

As for """"aberoo"""", I honestly feel sad for you, because your beahviour and edits in Wikipedia clearly reveal that you suffer from an inferiority complex and nearly all your edits are about image and not about contents.  It is obvious that you try to present an image instead of contributing to contents.

""""Scientists occasionally invent hypothetical entities with special abilities as part of a thought experiment. These """"demons"""" have abilities that are nearly limitless, but they are still subject to the physical laws being theorized about.

For example, in Descartes' Second Meditation, it is argued, as a thought experiment, that it is at least possible that there is an all-powerful evil demon who is deceiving me, such that this demon causes me to have false beliefs, including the belief that there is an object before me and the belief that two plus three equals five. Note that the power of such a demon would be two-fold: both empirical and rational thinking can be completely compromised. This leads to a worrisome argument:

   1. One knows some fact or other only when one can rule out that there is such a demon.
   2. But one can never be in a position rule out that there is such a being, since we can never be sure that the demon isn't merely toying with our epistemic situation.
   3. Thus, we can never know any facts at all!

 Moon: """"Time to Beat Swords into Plowshares;"""" 85-Year-old Evangelist Proposes Bering Strait """"Peace Tunnel,"""" Addresses Divisions in America, U.N. Reform in Interfaith Meeting 

WHAT: """"10th Annual True Family Values Awards Banquet"""" News Conference 

WHEN: TODAY, Sept. 24, 11 a.m. Diplomat Room 

WHERE: Hyatt Regency O'Hare, Grand Ballroom, 9300 Bryn Mawr Ave., Rosemont, Ill. 

WHO: Rev. and Mrs. Sun Myung Moon; Archbishop George Augustus Stallings, Imani Temple African American Catholic Congregation; Imam Ameer Salahuddin, Islamic Center of Passaic County; Pastor Leroy Elliott, New Greater St. John Missionary Baptist Church; Rabbi David Ben-Ami, American Forum for Jewish-Christian-Muslim Cooperation; Rev. Jesse Edwards, Pentecostal Family Church, Philadelphia, PA; Rev. A. P. Randall, Pastor of Twelve Gates Missionary Baptist Church; Rabbi Dr. Mordechai Waldman, Southfield, MI; Rev. Dr. C. Phillip Johnson, New Prospect Family Praise and Worship Center, Dr. Arnold Howard, Enon Baptist Church, national and local interfaith leaders. 

BACKGROUND: The Reverend Sun Myung Moon has launched what some believe is his final speaking tour in America, issuing a series of challenges to this nation. Rev. Moon's visit to Chicago coincides with the 10th Annual True Family Values Awards Banquet. A crowd expected at more than 2000 will help celebrate as a number of Chicago community leaders receive appointments as Ambassadors For Peace. The 12 US venues represent the first leg of a 100-city world tour to inaugurate the Universal Peace Federation. 

Asserting that peace cannot be achieved through diplomatic and military means alone, Moon emphasizes the need for interreligious reconciliation, calling for renewal and reform at the United Nations. Addressing the economic and racial divisions in America and the world, he proposes cooperative international efforts in key areas. """"Why must we continue pouring countless dollars into wars that, in the end, will never bring the reconciliation of enemies"""" Moon asks. """"The time has come for all countries to pool their resources and advance toward the world of peace desired by God."""" 

The still-dynamic spiritual leader has launched a dramatic appeal to the world community to undertake the most ambitious civil engineering project in history  a 51-mile bridge and tunnel connecting the United States and Russia, physically and symbolically uniting East and West, to be built across the Bering Strait at a cost of over $200bn. Moon asserts that such projects will help connect the world as a single community, generate economic development, and redirect the focus of the world's leadership. The Universal Peace Federation promotes interreligious reconciliation, family renewal and cooperative service for others as the basis for lasting peace. 

""""Rev. Moon has been building bridges all his life to bring the races and religions of the world together. It is natural that he would now launch this visionary appeal to physically unite the world in a project that demands peaceful cooperation.""""  Archbishop George Stallings, Christianity (Washington., D.C.) 

""""The man is hitting on all the spiritual hot buttons of contemporary society, including racial and interfaith relations, marriage and family, homosexuality, fighting AIDS, peace in the Middle East, and what is more, he's never pulled his punches.""""  Rev. Darryl Gray, Imani Family Church, Montreal, Canada

If the SSI is going to compare themselves to the CDC, that would discredit them even more. The CDC held an illegal conference along with other national and foreign public health agencies and representatives of vaccine manufacturers, and an advisory committee made up almost entirely of employees of pharmaceutical corporations. To make Hviid's case even weaker, the response did not address any of the errors spotted in the Denmark study (http://www.safeminds.org/research/docs/Hviid_et_alJAMA-SafeMindsAnalysis.pdf), it simply claimed all documented cases were included, which they clearly weren't. WP:FRINGE has to be unfounded in evidence, what we have is a 259 page transcript from the illegal meeting at Simpsonwood, 27 surviving confidential pages from Verstraetan's """"lost"""" study (http://www.safeminds.org/legislation/foia/Simpsonwood_Transcript.pdf), not to mention serious errors in all the other major epidemiological studies denying a link as evidence for such a collusion.

OK, thanks once again. Lately the anti-Polish man that goes by the name """"English Patriot Man"""" woke up again and started to ruin Wikipedia. Take a look at the changes provided by the IP address: """"83.24.216.55"""" what are all here:
http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Racism_in_Europe&action;=history
Could you check if the damages performed by this IP address were all fixed by User:Discospinster?
As you can see the English """"Patriot"""" Man (this time as an undercover IP) once again deleted all the information about the prejudice against Poles, and I don't know how to restore the version that was right before his numerous contribustions.   13:16, 23""",0,0,0,0,0,0
