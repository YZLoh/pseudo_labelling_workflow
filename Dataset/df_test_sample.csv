 == pinker isn't talking about evolution in this passage == 

 Pinker isn't talking about evolution in that passage he's talking about basic anthropology, and history.  His book as a whole is about evolution, but that passage is not.  Therefore, I've removed the responses to this criticism which deal with """"evolution"""", since he's not talking about it: 

 Some anarchist thinkersSeven Lies About Civilization, Ran Prieur do not share this vision of evolution, considering that this concept represents a way our culture justifies the values of modern industrial society and inherently as the way on how civilization was able to move the individuals further from there natural necessities.Industrial Society and Its Future, Theodore Kaczynski Besides the consideration of authors, such as John Zerzan, to the existence in tribal society has having less violence altogether, he and other authors such as Theodore Kaczynski talk about other forms of violence on the individual in advance countries, generally expressed by the term """"social anomie"""", that result from the system of monopolized security. These authors do not dismiss the fact that man is changing while adapting to this different social realitiesIndustrial Society and Its Future, Theodore Kaczynski, but consider them an anomaly, nevertheless. The two end results being that we either disappear or become something very different, distant from what we have come to value in our nature. It has been suggested by experts that this shift towards civilization, trough domestication, has caused an increase in diseases, labor and psychological disordersThe Consequences of Domestication and Sedentism by Emily Schultz, et al. 

 I also removed this: 

  
 There is an ongoing debate within the subject of evolutionary psychology, where neo-tribalists proponents have reference to it to claim prove of their political beliefs, while other authors have an opposite position. 

  
 Neo-tribalists are not evolutionary psychologists.  within evolutionary psychology there is no debate over the idea that primitive societies were (on the whole, even if not always) more violent than modern ones, with higher percentages of death even compared to World War II. """

I mean how many people need to look at a black and white image with a colour table to realise it has been faked?? 

 This has kept me amused for 2 years, but the joke has worn off. I didn't put it there by the way, but its funny that so many people have looked at that and not noticed. 

 In case anyone doubts its a fake, here is a list of things that are wrong with the photo: 
 1. Welles is in black and white, there are colour parts of the photo. 
 2. The newspaper in the background has been cut and pasted. 
 3. Welles has been cut and pasted (You can see the rectangular outline).

 : The article, as it stands, documents ethnobotanical medicinal uses of plants. I certainly agree that """"tonic"""" isn't a useful word in modern medicine, but there's a wealth of documentary evidence that the concept exists and is ascribed to particular plants in a number of medical traditions, both historically and currently, in various parts of the world. I think that the controversy over this article boils down to this: 

 :* One set of editors (including myself) is trying to document what properties traditional medicine practitioners have ascribed to plants that they particularly value. Speaking only for myself, the motivation for doing so is that - who knows? - maybe some of them actually do have these properties, and it's probably worth paying attention. Some plants clearly do have medicinal properties. Garlic, for example, became the principal antibiotic during World War I, when supplies of more powerful, modern drugs dried up. There's a huge body of knowledge that I think is important to record. In cases where these plants have been shown not to have these properties, this ought to be noted in the article. 

 :* Another set of editors strongly believes that no mention of medicinal properties should be made without peer-reviewed scientific papers that categorically demonstrate these properties. In my opinion,this leaves no room for any treatment of traditional medicine, from any POV other than rejecting it out of hand. That's clearly not in the spirit of Wikipedia. There's no POV involved in saying, """"These four books say that this plant was used by these people for these purposes."""" 

 : I should add that summarily deleting all references, particularly when the person who did so is the very same person who demanded them in the first place, comes perilously close to - sorry - vandalism. Even with the best of interpretations, it's hard to see evidence of good faith in some of the recent edits.  """

132cb9b3d64d8c64,"""Elonka has raised two issues, first concerning the role of admins, second concerning my statement about Jagz being a racist troll.  First, I cannot disagree with you more strongly about admins being authority figures.  Wikipedia is an open society in which the only authority figures are Jimbo, for legal reasons, and Arb Com, which has a limited mandate.  Admins are given the ability to perform certain technical tasks that are required for the functioning of the community.  They should never use these abilities to serve their own interests, and should never claim that their being given certain technical tasks to perform in any way gives them any kind of authority.  In fact, I believe that to encourage the view that admins are authority figures does tremendous damage to the Wikicommunity.  People new to Wikipedia may look for an authority structure because most people who come to Wikipedia come from highly authoritarian societies.  We need to disabuse them of this notion.  Wikipedians have few obligations but the very nature of the wikicommunity dmands that its members resist attempts to create authoritarian structures.  I have never, absolutely never refered to my status as admin in any dispute with any editor.  It is not relevant; I do not make it relevant; those who believe it is relevant are mistaken; those who insist it is relevant are doing damage to the community.  In my dealings with Jagz I appealed, as I do with any other disagreement with any other editor, to common sense and wikipedia policies, and nothing more.  Conversely, the fact that he was not an admin had no bearing on our conflict either.  I know that there are those at Wikipedia who believe that Wikipedians should be divided into classes with different privileges and expectations.  What does Elonka mean when she says there are """"junior members"""" of Wikipedia?  Anyone can edit at any time; that is all that really counts here and it is a right given to absolutely anyone.  What does Elonka mean when she says that there are """"junior members"""" who """"dream"""" of becoming aminds?  Does she mean that they dream of having authority or of being authority figures?  I hope to high heaven not, because that is not what Wikipedia is about and we should fight any attempt to make it so.  If people want to dream of ecoming authority figures they can play Dungeons and Dragons, or they can be active in Everything2 which is sent up to promote explicit levels of authority.  Wikipedia is not, which is why I am inactive at Everything2 and am active here.  I consider this abhorrent and will oppose it until I leave or am kicked out.  Elonka is free to disagree with me but as far as I am concerned she is dead wrong. 

 Second, Elonka thinks that my calling Jagz a racist troll is a """"personal attack"""" and """"incivil.""""  I am confused.  Is Elonka saying there are no such thing as trolls?  Or is she saying we should tolerate trolls?  Wikipedia has long had a guideline, """"do not feed the trolls"""" (WP:DNFTT).  Why would we have such a guideline, if there were no trolls?  Is Elonka proposing that we do away with the """"do not feed the troll"""" guideline?  Well, she is free to write her own essay on the topic.  But I have been here a long time and next to people who dig authority trips, trolls are the greatest menace I know of to the project.  When a troll is active at Wikipedia it is essential that we identify them and ncourage others not to feed them, which is precisely what I did.  Elonka is right that I have been around a long time.  If this matters at all to newbies, it can only matter because of what I have learned from experience and what I have learned is how to recognize trolls, and that we should have a zero-tolerance approach to them.  I cannot believe that anyone who would call themselves a responsible member of Wikipedia would actually disagree with this view and suggest that we should on the contrary feed trolls.  That is just absurd.  Are you really saying we should delete WP:DNFTT Elonka? 

 Also, I called Jagz a racist because every disruption of his was motivated by his insistence on giving prominence to the view that blacks are inherently less intelligent than whites.  Sorry, Elonka, but that is racism.  And racism is wrong.  Do you really believe racism is right, Elonka?  Then we have another area where we disagree.  But let there be no mistake: ir is racism which is incivil and an attack on others.  To criticize someone for racism is to criticize someone for attacking others and for being incivil ... indeed, it is to criticize someone for being worse than incivil.  And look, kif we Wikipedians are told to reject incivility, then surely, we should reject racism even more strongly.  Do you think Wikipedia should tolerate racism, and allow its pages to be used to promote racism, Elonka? 

 Finally, Elonka believes that my assertion that people who considered Jagz' calling Mathschi a """"fucking bastard"""" who"

 :::::: So the difference is that Eusebio registered himself as the child's father, and it is noteworthy that this occurred exactly during the culmination of the investigation of sexual abuse. Your grandmother, on the other hand, can claim you as her 'legal guardian', but she cannot register herself as your mother. There is a clear distinction because firstly, your grandmother did not register herself as anyone's birth mother, and secondly, I'm sure she was not being charged with rape (I pray to God she wasn't) during the time she claimed legal guardianship. 

 :::::: This is an excerpt from the article: """"AarÃ³n JoaquÃ­n, eventually recognized the infant and registered him as his own son"""". I don't make any 'leaps' when I say Eusebio was illegally having sex with women other than his wife (specifically underage women). His admission of guilt for any wrongdoing is only compounded when he registered himself as the father. There are no false implications in what I just wrote, and if I make a mistake, however obvious it may be, I ensure to acknowledge it. But in this case, I made no leap.   

 :::::: Also, who says that a newspaper or two can't point to facts? You mean to say that you're against what academians use on a daily basis for their research?! So long as it's not a fictional tabloid, it's perfectly reliable. Keep in mind the painstaking work and oversight of researchers, writers, editors, senior producers, and other staff that goes into publishing every newspaper, journal, and book. In actuality you're confusing """"bias"""" for """"validity"""". Simply because a publisher focuses their work on taboo topics does not mean it is unreliable. As anthropologists, it is important to cover every aspect of their subject matter, regardless of how unacceptable their publication may sound to you or anybody else. 

 :::::: As for the Protocols of Elders of Zion, there's countless books that refute and prove the fraudulent nature of it. I do agree that ANY predisposed beliefs based on intolerance of others' race, religion, and beliefs, not just against Jews, but against all minorities, are false. 

 :::::: Now that we're on the topic of intolerance, this brings me nicely to my last point. It seems to me that you may be finding ways to discredit any claims made against the church founder because, frankly, I believe you to be a member of the church (which I frequently encounter on wiki lldm, but that's okay). This could potentially become a huge problem when you edit the controversy section because of the following: 

 :::::: The basis for your arguments against those updating and protecting the """"Controversy"""" section becomes flawed because any argument that is contrary to members of lldm's beliefs is """"intolerable"""" to you (to see what I'm referring to please read or google Genetic Fallacy http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_fallacy ). Even the La Revista Academica is somehow distasteful to you. Thus your arguments become based on a discreet dislike of people who are not on your side of thought (just like Protocols of Elders of Zion was intolerant of Jews, you're now intolerant of scholars who want to give light to the personal lives of church leaders), and that becomes a catatlyst for you try to remove as much content from the controversy section (which is impossible by the way). Do you believe that Samuel Joaquin is the Apostle of God? ~V3ritas

 First, the use of 'rebel' to decribe the native Irish does in fact imply that Irish resistance to English rule was unusual, was exceptional. The word in this context was designed to establish English rule as the norm in society. CiarÃ¡n Brady devotes some time to discussing this in his book on Shane O Neill/SeÃ¡n an DÃ­omais and points out that it was O Neill and his struggles which represented the norm in society and, if any group had been 'rebelling', it was the English government of Ireland which was rebelling against the norm. It is a thoughtless word for a professional historian to use; an acceptance of the English view of the time as fact. Second, because Irish-born worked in the English government doesn't make it less colonial, no more than Algerian-born Pied Noir working for the French made the French government in Algeria less colonial. In fact, native-born workers are part of every colonial government and all works on colonialism and settler-colonialism incorporate them into the structure of those types of government. Third, to claim that the government was 'Irish domestic' implies that domestic Irish concerns were at its heart. With just a flicker of thought towards the English attitude towards the Gaelic world, Ireland's majority culture, this is patently untrue. The refusal to allow even Irish-born Old English head the government confirms that in English eyes the nascent Old English community was not to be trusted in government (and they were not). It was a government which was fully controlled by the English, most especially from Sussex's deputyship, and to claim it was a 'domestic Irish' government is simply ahistorical. The resistance to English policies from 1556 to 1583, and the ultimate defeat of the Old English, confirms beyond doubt English colonial control over the government."

 ::I just subst'ed all your userboxes.  Basically, your userboxes used to be neat, clean little templates that, whenever anyone would load your userpage, would pick up their little Wiki phone and call over to the template page, where all the ugly code is, and say, """"Hey, listen, if all that ugly code were actually on this page, instead of being over there, what would it look like?""""

The up side is, ain't no one gonna take your FSM box away from you (unless these people expand the anti-userbox campaign to going page by page).  The new speedy deletion policy only applies to templates, and because your userboxes aren't templates anymore, they can't be deleted as being too """"divisive.""""

 ==Requested move== 

 :The following discussion is an archived debate of the proposal. Please do not modify it. Subsequent comments should be made in a new section on the talk page. No further edits should be made to this section.  

 The result of the debate was move. Do not revert this move. â  Seen this already?  
 Cavaliers (royalists)  â Cavalier Primary meaning of the word. """"Cavaliers (royalists)"""" was moved from Cavaliers yesterday, before the name had one plural now it has two! There are around 400 wiki pages linked to this topic none of the others pages  with the word Cavalier in them come close to that number of links   

 ===Survey=== 
 :Add *Support or *Oppose followed by an optional one-sentence explanation, then sign your opinion with ~~~~ 

  
 ::*Support  Makes perfect sense to me. Standard should be to use the singular form in its most common meaning as the base article. -   
 ::*Support That's a good idea to move it.  It's very silly for cavalier to redirect to one particulary form of it. -  
 ::*Support Seems very sensible indeed.   
 ::*Oppose In truth I support a move but not nessecerily this move. """"Cavaliers (royalists)"""" does need some changing, yet with all the cavalier (disambiguation) it seems improper to be placing this article as the Calavier. Cavaliers, as presented in the intorduction and on the Roundheads article seems like a sound alternative.  
 :Done. â  Seen this already?  
 ::*Support a move that seems to have been properly made, then improperly reverted. The primary meaning is the royalist one, the others are derivative and minor. A search on the Paladin and Cavalry pages finds no mention of the word in articles that are supposedly a disambiguation of its meaning. Oddly, there is no mention of cavalier as an adjective which refers to the supposed attitude of the royalists. As said before, the standard should be the singular most common usage, which this clearly is. ...,   

 ==Further discussion== 

 Oppose Per above comment from Dryzen, pointing Cavalier(s) to this specific instance, albeit the apparent original occurence of this term. In addition, I've redirected all the instances of the above 400 to Cavaliers (royalists).  Perhaps a double plural is invalid however having fixed each of the links to point to the specific article seems to fit the criteria above, so I'll move if there is not objection. NetK  

 :You, , moved the page to """"Cavaliers (royalists)"""" at 02:03, 29 April 2006, less than a minute after you posted the above. That does not seem to me a sufficient time to see if """"there is not objection"""" to you reverting a WP:RM move! I object strongly to your reversion. This was an agreed WP:RM move, of which I informed you personally on the day I proposed the move   and here is your reply on my talk page .

 : In 1999, the part of the population of the Paris metropolitan area living in Ile-de-France represented 98.996% of its total population. The same year, the part of the population of Ile-de-France living in the Paris metropolitan area represented 97.023% of its total population. In 1999, the demographical difference between Ile-de-France and the Paris metropolitan area was about 2%. There's nothing illegitimate in considering the Ile-de-France GDP as an estimation of the Paris metropolitan area.

 ::Normally, I would agree, however.... WP:NOR. You need to have a precise source for the data, estimations from data on other regions/populations is considered original research.   
 No, no and no.

 The abstract array axioms in the current version are:

 :for any array state A, any value V, and any tuples I, J for which the operations are defined. 
 Methink that this is not OK because: 
 *To write an sbtract algorithm that scans an array, one needs to know the set of valid indices.  This requires additional operations and possibly other axioms. 
 *These axioms say nothing about time and space costs, so they allow implementations where the cost of get/set is proportional to the size of A (or worse). This is not good when analyzing the performance of algorithms that use arrays. 
 *The axioms also allow an Awk-style array that creates any element that gets assigned to, but fails when reading a non-existent element. 
 *In fact they are satisfied by a """"pea-brained"""" Awk array where each set(A,I,V) creates A[I] and destroys all other elements. 
 My idea for fixing the last two bugs was to introduce a """"FAIL"""" value to be the result of accessing an invalid index,  and postulate that get(FAIL,I) = set(FAIL,I,V)=FAIL for all I,V; and then remove the phrase """"for which the operations are defined"""".  However then the first axiom is violated if I is an invalid index.

 == Assertion of copyright to what an editor wrote and added to Wikipedia == 

 Dear Sir: I have withdrawn my own texts and translations of the cantigas d' amigo from the article on that topic.  They are copyrighted material.  Other 'editors', through their ignorance and arrogance, insults and abuse, have made me give up all hope of trying to improve anything in Wikipedia, namely on the subjects which are my main area of research, medieval Galician-Portuguese philology and poetry.  Please do not put those texts back.  Rip Cohen, alias MB 

 :I do not know enough about Galician-Portuguese literature to adjudicate your dispute with FilipeS.  (I noticed your page blanking only after watching  for the first time recently in connection with a minor discussion about an unrelated merge.)  If I did know more, I can assure you that I would respect your academic credentials and do my best to make sure that everything valuable in your contributions receive a warm welcome into Wikipedia, subject to the normal collaborative reworking & pursuit of consensus (see WP:OWN).  What I do know, however, is that every time you clicked """"Save"""" to make a contribution to Wikipedia, you did so on these terms: """"By submitting content, you agree to release your contributions under the GNU Free Documentation License.  If you don't want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistributed for profit by others, do not submit it.""""  This encyclopedia would not function at all if editors had the right to demand that their contributions be used only on special terms they invented.  So your assertion of control over your contributions will not impress the community of editors.  I am not a lawyer; of course there are guidelines and procedures for disputes involving copyright.  But on reading the text I link, it seems obvious and implicit that, since you admit contributing your material under the GFDL license, deletion is not required.  (While, again, I am not a lawyer & do not speak on behalf of Wikipedia, it does seem that if you do not possess the copyright to your contributions, then, perhaps, you infringed on your publisher's rights by licensing it to Wikipedia, and your publisher might be able to make a valid protest.) Of course, contributions from scholarly sources should receive due attribution when appropriate, and you should bring it up on a talk page if you think this would be appropriate.  I want to end this by saying for the third time that I'm not a lawyer, and for all I know you have a legitimate claim, and there is an established dispute resolution process that can serve you.  But deleting content you freely gave to the encyclopedia doesn't seem the best way to approach it.  Moreover, I hope that the spirit of generosity that first moved you to give your work as a gift to this free encyclopedia still carries some weight, despite your disgruntlement & frustration with FilipeS.  If you take the time to document such points as """"All competent scholars use the term Cantiga d'amigo,"""" then I have faith that, eventually, even obscure article talk pages will attract enough notice that the view based on reliable sources will prevail.  Respectfully,   """

 * In reference to Template:Tv-stub  I'm absolutely willing to drop my objections to  if you're willing to privately send me a 300-pixel-wide version of your photograph to prove that it's not based on the copyrighted image. But as far as I can tell, it's a pixel for pixel duplication of the original image, which I've been using for eight years now on my own site in a licensed form, so I'm pretty familiar with it. Now, if you managed to reconstruct that yourself from new sources, I've just got to tip my cap to you for an excellent job. If it's not an exact copy of the original, it's a perfect reconstruction. But I have to admit it seems less likely to me that you made an original shot using a TV model that looks pixel-for-pixel identical to the infringing image. Hence my assumption. If it is based on a real source photo, it should be easy for you to clear up any doubts."

Currently, any content which is not really favourable to LBP's perspective is accused of being biased irrespective of verifiability and are being eliminated. I'm a bit tired of telling them that, if an American news media says that Japan object to signing treaty due to insufficient protection given to domestic abuse victim and a published academic paper written by an American law professor says that domestic abuse protection is an area which is seriously defective in the Hague Convention, then such content should stay.  

 ::It is more important that they understand that my edits and contribution are legitimate and that their conduct in and outside of wikipedia is serious breach of wikipedia civility.

 Hi, the my WP:CSD#R3 requests for Eatb and Not the bees weren't because the redirects are implausible typos but because they are implausible (not common) misnomers.    
 :Okay, and sorry if my explanation wasn't complete (but neither allows a standard Twinkle tag for a more detailed reasoning) , but a misnomer would somehow suggest a wrong interpretation. As far as I see the first is an uncapitalised abbreviation, possibly uncommon, but no misnomer, while the second seems to be a tagline or quote, of which we have others, such as """"Motherfucking snakes on a motherfucking plane"""". I agree both are hardly useful, but neither would seem to warrant a speedy deletion per R3. Please list such cases at WP:RFD.   
 ::Thanks for the clarification. Sometimes it's annoying what Twinkle won't let you do. I've taken Not the bees to WP:RFD, but given the discussion at the link you've given I think it might fail, hey-ho. In retrospect I think Eatb/EATB might be a useful link. Cheers,

 Thanks for letting me know about this debate. The guy who nominated it for deletion didn't notify me, he obviously didn't want me to participate in the discussion about my own userspace.

I'm not """"broadcasting"""" anything, I do intend to work on improving the article, but unfortunately I don't have as much time these days, and there are other issues too. 

 I do think the article deletion discussion was extremely unfair; the closing admin refused to discard the numerous votes by Turkish meatpuppets and sockpuppets and acknowledge the progress we made improving it. All that abuse really makes it hard to work on the article again.

 ===Attempt to amplify the above=== 
 Which is cause and which effect? If you consider the continents to be at any given time floating like pucks on an air-hockey table - in extreme slow motion - then once they move they keep on going until stopped. This presupposes a lateral acceleration to get them moving, the build-up of sufficient momentum to keep them going against resistance from tectonic activity, and a purely mechanical consideration of energy absorption during collisions. These collisions may therefore spark one of absorption of the crust (subduction), folding (collision), or """"bouncing"""" (the continents may strike a glancing blow and further motion may be reversed or rotation may take over, like two air hockey pucks hitting each other). 

 If you keep on going in this reasoning there seems to be little reason why a supercontinent would split in the first place. Although it seems that the continental crust may be weakened by thermal effects, if it splits in the middle of the continent you would need an enormous push to get things moving as the supercontinent must be well anchored and have maximum inertia. One might expect that a volcanic ridge would form and """"overflow"""" rather than actually create tectonic plates, or that volcanic action would be confined in perpetuity to the plate edges.  Once in motion, however, the parts of that supercontinent would, in the absence of other forces, move around the globe and then meet up again in a different configuration. The """"other forces"""" are what complicates matters. 

 The original energy available in the original rifting is not known; nor are the stiffnesses of the rocks around where it occurred (we always work backwards in time, stating that rifting seems to have occurred here and there). It also seems to be directional, discontinuous and unstable (look at what seems to have happened to Africa, Antarctica and Australia during their split from Pangaea - India hurries north, Australia flies west, Antarctica shuffles south, and Africa moves a little north, while Madagascar moves in the opposite direction (or possibly stays where it was, but that is a private opinion). In addition, one cannot assume that these events are not counteracted elsewhere - the passage of a continent must cause ructions along all its edges, and this around the globe, so one rifting may influence another. If a plate moves say east, will it produce rifting along its western edge, and will this act as an """"outboard motor"""" to keep it accelerating? Furthermore, the whole earth is in motion, spinning on its axis, with gravitational forces involved that can also influence the dispersion of crustal plates. It is a many-body problem with far too many factors involved for more than top-level analysis by myself as a layman.

 :In my experience, at least in the modern garage punk scene, the previous role of cassettes is being replace by vinyl and mp3's; CDs as a whole are not an appropriate inheritor of cassette culture, and in fact aren't very popular in the community.  Mainly, I think it has to do with the cost of CDs in stores ($15/CD vs. $8 for an LP), the fact that they're not very durable (scratch, scratch), the cost of in-home CD players vs. turntables, and the old-style feel and sound (real or imagined) of records.  With the advent of mp3s and portable mp3 players, CDs aren't really necessary at all, even home-made ones.   

 :By way of example, most of the bands I come into contact with don't even release their music on CD at all.  The Spits, for example, released their first album on CD, and haven't made another release on CD since, even though their popularity has increased.  

 :As for postal service vs. cassettes, I don't think we're making a confusion here.  True, """"Mail art"""" is important, but cassette trading was as much a matter of person to person interaction as it was long-distance interaction.  The """"cassette"""" aspect of it is important because of the nature of cassettes; they can be recorded, re-recorded, copied directly, &c.;, and for most people of the time they were the only recordable media available (1/4 inch was expensive).

 == Reliable sources == 

 You idea of conducting a scientific experiment for the sake of a Wikipedia article is laudable in intself. However, this is not a good way to go. 

 As an encyclopedia, Wikipedia should only contain information that is verifiable. Regulation of body mass of mammals (such as humans) is the subject of scientific research, in this instance, physiology. Therefore, you will have to understand how scientific knowledge is achieved. 

 The individual researcher cannot investigate a complex phenomenon such as body mass regulation without taking into account the experimental results and the ideas of other researchers. If you type """"body mass"""" into the search engine of Pubmed, you will get about 65,000 entries. This means, there have been 65,000 studies in this area, but, alas, the topic is still controversial. If you publish your proposed study, there will be 65,001 studies. This will not change anything in the whole picture, unless your contribution is really revolutionary (and you will be eligible for the Nobel prize). Moreover, no other scientist will take your contribution for serious if you publish it in the Washington Post or syndicate it. If your findings revolutionize the field, your fellow researchers will be very suspicious if you did not publish them in a reputable scientific journal. 

 You might say that there are plenty of scientific theories that were rejected by the scientific community for a long time before they became finally accepted. See continental drift (discovered by Alfred Wegener) or transposons (discovered by Barbara McClintock). These theories took decades to be generally accepted, nevertheless, they were first published in peer-reviewed scholarly journals, and not in the Washington Post.  

 So, instead of trying to abuse a daily paper, try to go through the 65,000 studies summarized in PubMed, and find those who corroborate your ideas.

 Chavez: ``there is a permanent revolution in Venezuela 
 By Roberto Jorquera 
 January 10,2007 marked the swearing in of Hugo Chavez as President of Venezuela. It was used by Chavez to reiterate and clarify the direction that the Bolivarian revolution would be taking during his term in office, which lasts till 2013. In his speech Chavez stated, ``This new period of constructing socialism has barely began. ``Jan 10 finishes the period of transition, this has been a transition of 3000 days (since the last constituent assembly), we are constructing the building which will be Venezuela's socialism, said Chavez. 

 Chavez used most of his speech to once again analyse and explain the history of the Bolivarian revolution since his failed military coup of 1992. But he also stressed that this will be a fundamentally new period in the Venezuelan revolution with many changes occurring quickly. ``People voted for a project a line of march which has been clarified as socialism. It is socialism that people need and that the country needs, said Chavez. 

 Most importantly Chavez emphasised the need to change the Venezuelan constitution and the need to make the Consejos Communales (communal councils) the fundamental and post important political decision making body in the country. Chavez said ``we need a constituent power in Venezuela that will draft a new constitution. This needs to have the revolutionary injection for the Bolivarian revolution. We need this so that the revolution never finishes, said Chavez. 

 On the issue of the constitution Chavez highlighted the need to change article 302 of the constitution which currently states, ``The State reserves to itself, through the pertinent organic law, and for reasons of national expediency, the petroleum industry and other industries, operations and goods and services which are in the public interest and of a strategic nature. Chavez made it clear that such an article was not specific enough and that it needed to include other natural resources on top of petroleum. 

 Another law that was singled out for change was the code on commerce which Chavez noted was over 100 years old and that the last change to the law was in 1955. ``What sort of socialism can we build with such laws, asked Chavez. ``There are many things in the constitution that we need to clarified and rewrite, said Chavez. 

 Chavez went further to state that, ``We have to get rid of any references to privatisation in the constitution we are not going to privatise anything anymore. It was made clear during his speech that the new government will move quickly on further state control of the main and strategic industries of the country. 

 During his speech Chavez stressed the need to strengthen communal power in Venezuela and that the revolution was just beginning but that no one should be worried about this next stage. Chavez once again used Trotsky to explain his position stating, ``Trotsky said that the revolution was permanent, it never finishes. Lets go with Trotsky. It is Trotsky who is correct that the revolution does not finish. 

 The final third of his speech concentrated on the political changes that needed to be undertaken in the new period. Chavez once again stressed the need of the importance of the United Socialist Party. ``What we need is unity, said Chavez. ``We are moving towards a united socialist party, which needs to be elected from the base, said Chavez. Also up for attention was the need to combat bureaucracy, inefficiency and corruption in the municipalities, which Chavez said was part of the fourth republic but needed to be eliminated. ``The fourth republic is still alive at the municipal level we need to dismantle it, said Chavez. 

 In relation to developing a new ``geometry of power in Venezuela Chavez stressed the need for a ``revolutionary explosion of communal power... Communal power needs to be the number one power. Chavez said that this was necessary as part of ``distributing economic, social, political and military power in Venezuela. 

 A new political structure was envisaged by Chavez which would not only develop and strengthen the communal councils but also work towards developing a federation of communal councils.``we need to create a system of cities which is based on federations, regions which are federal... It is part of building a socialist model which is part of a federal area that is organised by communal power, said Chavez.. 

 ``We need to build communal cities, socialist cities, said Chavez. ``They need to be able to make diagnostic assessment of their local area'', Chavez continued. ``We need a confederation of communal councils on a national level. We need to transform power to the communal power. Economic, political, power needs to be transferred to these local"

Unfortunately, the flying saucer returning them to Earth malfunctioned and crashed into either the WTC or Pentagon on 9/11 (your choice) which, of course, led to another cover-up involving hundreds of sleeper MIB personnel posing as airline passengers, four specially modified stealth bombers painted to look like UA and AA airliners, and the biggest wienie roast in Manhatten history. The repercussions of this are with us today because the aliens got pissed with Cheney and G. W. Bush (both card carrying members of both the alien conspiracy and the Illuminati) for their botching of the 9/11 coverup leading to the selection of a hybrid Illuminati/space alien as the next president of the United States. Time for my medication...seriously he probably was promoted to 1st Lt. in '52 although I don't have the 10 required references to prove this.   """

 hey skookum1 
 Yah, I saw the article was flagged for improvement so I added a few things.  It obvioulsy will need to be cleaned up and citations added, but I am a bit too busy at the moment.  Will get to it though. 

 I am not familiar with your Teit reference at the moment.  Part of the confusion was that Boas/Teit classified the Sinixt within the larger """"Okanagan"""", but then subdivided the Okanagan proper to sometimes include a """"Lake"""" division, as opposed to the """"Lakes"""" which is always a reference to the sinixt.  My suspicion is that he was referring to the former, although I am definately interested. 

 I will also add a language stub.  I recall reading it was similar to colville, but more 'drawn out'.   

 Teit (and others) describe the late pre-contact war with the Ktunaxa, in which the Sinixt were eventually able to stop the aggressors by a final large-scale raid on the Southern Ktunaxa. 

 There is, however, quite a lot of evidence that there was significant regional conflict at some time prior to the smallpox.  Many pithouse villages seem to have been abandoned in the 1400s.  I suspect that there was major Athabaskan/Salish/Ktunaxa conflict far beyond the basic Nicola/chilcotin enigma.  Let's not forget that the Apache/navajo etc. had only just arrived in the Southern plains when the Spanish got there in the 1500s (The Apache were reeking havoc at the time amongst the non-nomadic peoples who were indigenous to the area.).  There are differing theories among archeologists about whether it was strictly a plains migration or 'inter-montaine'."""

 (1) This is an article about the Autonomous Community of Galicia, a political entity within Spain. 

 (2) The official name of this entity in BOTH Spanish AND Galician is """"Galicia"""", not """"Galiza"""".  As the text further down makes clear, the term """"Galiza"""" (identical to the name of the region in Portuguese) is championed by sectors of Galician nationalism who abhor anything or any term which smacks of """"Spanishness"""". 

 (3) The version of the article you are seeking to peddle is misleading by virtue of giving the impression that the spelling """"Galiza"""" enjoys some sort of co-official status with """"Galicia"""".  It does not. 

 I do not know whether you are simply ignorant of the true position, or disingenuously giving vent to some anti-Spanish cum Galician nationalist agenda of your own.  Either way, please do not insult my intelligence (or that of other English Wikipedia) users by posing as a disinterested or impartial adjudicator on this issue."""

d58ec9395cddcebd,"""You're saying Steyn linked to an article that accused him of """"raw racism"""" in the most prominent place on his site as a joke? That seems to me implausible; even you say it only """"may"""" be the case. I think your tone is, sadly, clearly abusive. I don't think anybody could interpret attacking a sincerely meant entry as an """"overly long, wandering, and ridiculously padded treatise astroturfing your friend Hari's works"""" as anything other than abuse, I'm afraid. Please try to engage with my arguments politely. 

 As I say above: A wiki user posting above makes the point, which I think is reasonable, that at the moment the 'crticisms' section consists solely of the conclusions critics make about him without the reasoning behind them. Therefore it sounds like a string of insults. I was trying to rectify that by giving both a criticism and the reasoning behind it. Since Hari's review is described by Steyn himself as """"the long-awaited liberal takedown"""" of his book, it seems a reasonable criticism to do this with. If the wording wasn't great, by all means improve it - but removing the criticism all together is not reasonable, nor I'm afraid is your consistently insulting tone. 

 Please respond to this point without abuse.

 Established in 1999, the Center for Economic Policy and Research seeks to promote debate on economic and social issues. Its co-founders, economists Dean Baker and Mark Weisbrot, hold Ph.D.'s from the University of Michigan, and they strive to communicate to policymakers and the general public through a variety of publications, including columns and blogs. One of the most popular is Baker's """"Beat the Press,"""" accessible on the Web site of the American Prospect. It critiques media coverage of economic issues. (paragraph break) Baker and Weisbrot offer a left-of-center analysis of trade policy issues, including the Doha negotiations. Baker, for example, is critical of so-called free trade agreements, viewing them primarily as investment agreements to lure manufacturers abroad to utilize low-cost labor in competition with U.S. workers. CEPR strives to address a variety of economic topics, and its advisory board includes Robert Solow and Joseph Stiglitz, two Nobel-prize winning economists. (para break) Publications: For literature related to trade and globalization, see CEPR's Web site.""""

 ==Your contributed article, Summarization of the gospels of matthew and luke== 
  Hello, I notice that you recently created a new page, Summarization of the gospels of matthew and luke. First, thank you for your contribution; Wikipedia relies solely on the efforts of volunteers such as you. Unfortunately, the page you created covers a topic on which we already have a page - Matthew and Luke. Because of the duplication, your article has been tagged for speedy deletion. Please note that this is not a comment on you personally and we hope you will to continue helping improve Wikipedia. If the topic of the article you created is one that interests you, then perhaps you would like to help out at Matthew and Luke - you might like to discuss new information at the article's talk page.  

 If you think that the article you created should remain separate, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page that has been nominated for deletion (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag - if no such tag exists then the page is no longer a speedy delete candidate and adding a hangon tag is unnecessary), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. Lastly, please note that if the page does get deleted, you can contact one of these administrators to request that they  userfy the page or have a copy emailed to you. Additionally if you would like to have someone review articles you create before they go live so they are not nominated for deletion shortly after you post them, allow me to suggest the article creation process and using our search feature to find related information we already have in the encyclopedia. Try not to be discouraged. Wikipedia looks forward to your future contributions.   """

 ::Actually, , it's not.  The """"key description as 'privately funded'"""" is pretty accurate in that the first hundred million bucks of development, and the creation of the company was all Elon Musk, and another hundred million was from SpaceX VC investors.  In addition to the c. $200 million private funding, some specific development $$$ were paid by NASA for specific cargo vehicle characteristics that NASA wanted for cargo vehicles to take cargo to the ISS, and later about $75 million (to date) for specific development of crew carrying capabilities that NASA wanted SpaceX to develop.  Most of the other $$$ paid to SpaceX by NASA are merely the payments to date for buying two launches of a medium-class launch vehicle (these typically cost >$100 million per launch, although SpaceX prices to NASA are, I believe, quite a bit lower (per pound of payload) than the United Launch Alliance sells launches of its' flagship launch vehicles, the Atlas V and the Delta IV), or for partial payments for future cargo launches (12 of them under contract) where, due to US accounting rules on long-lead-time capital-intensive products, it has been usual for years in (even the commercial satellite) launch industry to pay substantial progress payments to the manufacturer beginning two years prior to the nominal launch date.  So SpaceX may have some hundred-millions of NASA money, but by far, most of it is merely payments for specific launch services, either already flown, or with launch vehicles in production, and a much smaller part of it is government-paid costs for SpaceX to develop specific product characteristics that the government wanted.   

 ::So you can't really count the purchase of specific SpaceX launches by NASA as government funding of the development of SpaceX's launch vehicles, the Falcon 1 and the Falcon 9.  This is all documented in a great many sources.  Hope this is helpful to you.  Cheers.    """

 :IMHO you are reading your POV into Price's statements.  There is nothing in what he is saying that shows he """"repudiated"""" FIT only that he could not find evidence of it being the primary cause.  In fact in chapter 18, Price states """"In my investigations regarding the types of individuals who develop rheumatic group lesions as a result of dental focal infections, (1) I found that individuals could be divided into very definite groups in which 15.05 per cent with severe lesions belonged to families in which similar disease symptoms had occurred. Evidence was disclosed of a systemic factor that played a controlling role in determining whether or not the individual would be seriously injured from dental focal infections. It became very clear that the soil was quite as important a determining factor as was the type of infection."""" 

 :Later on Price reiterates """"(i)t is very important that in the consideration of the dental caries problem it shall be kept in mind continually, that it is only one of a large group of symptoms of modern physical degeneration and when teeth are decaying other things are going wrong in the body. Fluorine treatment, like dental extractions, cannot be a panacea for dental caries.""""   

 :On a related side note the 1930 Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine, Volume 23, Issue 2 pg 1184 which mentions Price's work states """"dental sepsis is the commonest focus of infection in the body and must be garded as one of the most frequent sources of disease of adult life.""""  Remember that Pallasch specifically mentioned untreated pulpless teeth as being one of the many foci of infection in his 2000 article and his 2003 article goes over oral FIT past and present commenting on Price's work and states """"In the 1920s, the theory of focal infection was widely taught as the cause of a wide range of illnesses with infected teeth as the principal source"""".  It certainly doesn't help that dental sepsis covers a lot of ground including Tooth abscess and by that standard FIT is anything but dead in the dental community. 

 :Of course that goes back to the whole problem with FIT itselfeven if you limit yourself to Billings the mechanism covers an insane range of modern diseases including ones recognized by modern dentistry.   In that sense FIT itself never diedit just stopped being the be and end all as far as systemic disease was concerned. 

 :There are some other points we still need to fix in there article.  The fact that in 1918 there were issues regarding the FIT inspired extraction craze shows that Price's works didn't """" led to the widespread acceptance of the practice of extracting"""" as the article currently claims.  Furthermore if you actually go to the 2007 version of Ingle's the material does not support the claim it is being used to reference!  In fact, Ingles states that is was the work of British physician William Hunter in 1910 that lead orgy of extractions and the 100 percenters and then it talks about Price beginning his 25-study regarding FIT.  Which when you think about it doesn't make sense as Price's interest shifted from FIT to nutrition in 1925 only 15 years from when Hunter did his work.  """

I notice the 'image' page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. When you use a generic fair use tag such as {{fair use}} or {{fair use in|article name}}, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use.

 Hello, Tuli. A request has been made at Wikipedia:Changing username/Usurpations to usurp, or """"take over"""", your username because another user would like to use it to edit. The changing username guideline allows a username that is not being actively used to be usurped if the user is given an opportunity to object and does not do so.  

 If you have an email set in your preferences, you should be getting an email from a bureaucrat or changing username clerk explaining how to consent or object to this process.  

 If you do not object to being renamed to a new username in order for another user to use the name you currently have, please log in and post a reply here saying so (you may also tell us what username you would like to be renamed to, or we will provide you with a generic one).  

 If you do nothing: the request may be filled shortly, and your account will be moved to a generic username. You may request that it be moved to a new username of your choice at any time. 

 If you object to being renamed: please log in and make an edit to this page clearly stating that you object to usurpation. Any objection on your part will prevent usurpation. 

 Please note that even if your current username is usurped, you can still edit and your data will not be lost; your preferences, watchlist, and other user settings will be transferred to a new username. 

 Thank you for your time.      """

I encountered him when he showed up at Wikipedia talk:New pages patrol#Tag bombing new article within seconds of their creation complaining that 49 minutes after he created it, someone put these tags on it.  The discussion there goes round and round and finally got closed because it wasn't going to go anywhere (although I have no idea what AutomaticStrikeout was thinking when he suggested asking someone if they were still editing the page on their talk page).  Neotarf claimed translating work had been lost (in the article no less).  It was made abundantly clear to him at Talk:Carl Emil Pettersson why the tags where there, but he just doesn't get it.  I actually had the Swedish language book sent to my school so I could hopefully work with Neotarf (by scanning pages) to insert inline citations, .  I begin improving the article with some English language sources.  Adding one section about an upcoming movie based on Pettersson and using a source to add an inline citation to content previously written by Neotarf.  In what I'm assuming is an ownership issue, Neotarf removes my edits stating that he's removing counterfactual material.  I bring the issue to WP:RSN#Cineuropa where Neotarf begins claiming that the books don't exist, the movie doesn't exist, and the website in question doesn't have any editorial oversight, which, coming from him, is a bunch of bullocks.  He shows zero ability to collaborate, which is a huge issue of WP:CIR.  I picked an edit at random of his, not having time to go through all of his old edits, he's been here for over a year and he's still direct linking in text instead of referencing .  And when I mention WP:CIR, I don't in any way mean that he's """"incompetent"""".

339a8063723995ed,"In my opinion, his record cannot be defended rationally. He took over from a general who was fired for not attacking, in North Africa, then set back that general's planned date of attack. In his memoirs, Churchill says that it was impossible to replace him right after appointing him, so they had to stick with him. 

 ::The person who 'fired' the General for not attacking was Churchill - Churchill had recently halved the available forces in North Africa by sending 50% of them on an ill-fated attempt to support Greece - which was a failure. He then blamed the Generals for the lack of success in the desert and fired a number of them in quick succession. (at least a third of all British tank losses were due to simple mechanical breakdowns, often because of such simple things as lack of air filters which had not yet arrived - the need for which Churchill seemed incapable of understanding - or the absence of spare parts) If one reads books about the Desert War written by people who were there you find that the things they found most depressing before the arrival of Montgomery was the poor Staff Work, and the abysmal state of the supply situation, ie. logistics. (one A9 Cruiser Squadron had a full inventory of spares - for the A10 Cruiser). Once Montgomery took over he shook things up and the troops started getting what they needed, but this still took time and the reason Montgomery set back that general's planned date of attack was because his forces were not yet ready to do what they were being requested to do and he would not be cowed by Churchill into starting an attack which he was sure would fail - which is what the previous Generals had in fact done.  

 ::Churchill liked to think of himself as a military genius and strategist, but he wasn't - the words Gallipoli and Singapore come to mind as examples of his 'genius' (along with the sending of the Prince of Wales & Repulse to impress the Japanese), and when you read the memoirs of various high-ranking Cabinet members, Army, Royal Navy and RAF officers, you realise just how much of their time was wasted in trying to dissuade him from reckless and ultimately pointless enterprises."

 Hi Nawlin. Please can you undo the delete of the page for Monday records, or advise me what I need to do to get this approved. Pikachunes (featured on wikipedia), is a serious upcoming NZ electronic music artist. Many external sources confirm Pikachunes as a notably significant act (which is why he is on Wikipedia I suppose). Monday records have recently signed Pikachunes, so I think that makes Monday Records notable by association. Regardless of the Pikachines connection, I also think that an independent record label signing exciting new acts such as this is very notable. I believe (as with most music artist enteries) it is entirley appropriate to include a wiki page on this up coming independent record label, as they sign more and more culturally significant acts such as Pikachunes. Wikipedia is a common source of reference for the music industry, and it is very common place for relevant record labels to be featured along with artists. As well as links to the Monday Records site, I also linked to 3rd party music news blogs who announced the new signing, as they also felt it newsworthy and culturally significant. Please can you restore the article, or let me know what more I can do. Thank you for your time. All the best."

 ::: Does that answer your question about sources? These points are common to all the Buddhist schools and covered in the sutras - but a Buddhist scholar would be best to give the sources for them if you want more details.

 ::: Yes - I know there is a great deal of discussion of these topics. For sure it would be good to have a discussion section here. I have no problem with it discussing and criticizing these ideas. The issue is with it calling these ideas Buddhist without any sources to back up the claim that they are Buddhist ideas - and within a framework of non Buddhist concepts.  

 ::: It would be good to have a proper informed discussion of karma and comparison of the different ways it is understood in different traditions and problems with it. But this isn't it.  

 ::: Indeed if you check the sources given for many of the comments here - they come from a series of articles whose authors - as best I can tell (they are rather technical theological articles) - are looking at the possiblity of applying the Eastern idea of karma to give an explanation of why a just and good God can permit a world with evil and suffering in it. The article I read didn't claim to be an overview of Eastern ideas of karma - but rather an application of them to theology. That's why it is imbued throughout with ideas from Western theology that do not fit well with Eastern ideas. 

 ::: So - if this material is included -it needs to be made clear where it comes from and what the discussion is - and given its proper context, and because the sources are articles by Western Christian theologians - at least the ones I followed up - that is another reason why it belongs in the Western section.

 == Edit Request:Periyar as atheist == 
 First of all, thanks for answering my question. 

 But why should Periyar's views on Islam and Christianity be in Controversies section? On more than one occasion, Periyar has critized organized religions including Islam and Christianity. Is'nt Periyar's statement """" Bane of Tamizhians is Brahmins, Muslims and Christians consider themselves to Tamizhians"""" correct place the """"Religion and Atheism section? 

 Below two statements which are the author's own conclusion portray Periyar as favoring Christianity and Islam. 

 Periyar viewed Christianity similar to the monotheistic faith of Islam. He explained that their faith says that there can be only one God which has no name or shape. Periyar took an interest in Rev. Martin Luther, where both he and his followers wanted to liken him and his role to that of the European reformer. Thus, Christian views such as that of Ram Mohan Roy's The Precepts of Jesus has had at least an indirect influence on Periyar. 

 Anita Diehl.(1977) """"Personal View of the author"""" According to him, the first duty of a government is to run the social organisation efficiently, and that the philosophy of religion was to organise the social system. Periyar pointed out that while Christian and Islamic religions were fulfilling this role, the Hindu religion remained totally unsuitable for social progress. 

 Saraswathi. Towards Self-Respect 

 Just like Periyar's role as Dharmakartha of Hindu temples and Periyar's not cooking non-vegeteraian food for over a month for accomodating Marimalai Adigalar cannot be construed as his consideration for Hindu religion, the above two statements which are author's self views should removed."""

 ==ClichÃ© in history== 
 I feel most unhappy to have the work of an afternoon practically reverted, although it was excellently sourced. As it stands, this article has a fundamental problem with obsolete clichÃ© as regards the government of Elizabeth I. It is true that William Cecil was a sort of chief minister, but not in the sense that the situation with her """"court favourites"""" was a """"different matter"""". If that ever was historical thinking than it is hopelessly out of date. Even the concept of """"faction"""" at the Elizabethan court before the 1590's, which was very popular with Conyers Read and J.N. Neale in the earlier 20th century, has been shown to be practically rubbish. Cecil and Leicester worked most successfully together, as a kind of tandem (Christopher Hatton, another favourite, also was a most important privy councillor). These men do dont deserve only to be mentioned in a curious list, while Cecil (who was certainly not the typical favourite) is the main focus in the text proper.  

 There is a lot of newer scholarship on these things. May I quote from Simon Adams (my italics): But Cecil is not the only key figure:...The traditional picture of Leicester as a courtier-adventurer who rose to great heights through the Queen's misguided affection is based on a fundamental misconception. From the earliest years of the reign he was the inheritor of his father's following, and it was this that gave significance to his position as intimate and potential consort. Throughout the first three decades of the reign (until Leicester's death in 1588) the relationship between Cecil, Leicester and the Queen remained more or less unchanged. In the mid 1570s Sir Francis Walsingham and Sir christopher Hatton...became part of this inner ring, although Cecil and Leicester remained the most important councillors (Adams pp. 17â20)

You can do stuff like """"next Thursday"""" after a date, as well as specify timezone by location- handling daylight savings time adjustments correctly. The template basically wraps the #time function and relies on it to do the date arithmetic needed for the dtend calculation, which the old end date template doesn't do at all.

 To make a long story short, a couple of us were suspecting that some users that suddenly appeared out of nowhere making trouble and backing each other up were sockpuppets, and, it turns out, they more or less incriminated themselves. Read all about the festivities at Talk:Jehovah's_Witnesses#Dispute tags for Positive and Critical Links Sections, something one of them started in support of the other (sorry that there's a lot of unrelated stuff there), and the initial suspicions at Talk:Jehovah's_Witnesses#""""Wikipedia is not a mirror or a repository of links, images, or media files"""". But now that these first two basically incriminated themselves, we need to check on a few other users that also aroused suspicion before going around slapping sockpuppet tags on pages. I simply request a yes or no answer to a simple question: are these people from Denver (or the surrounding area in Colorado) too? Of course, if you do find some kind of smoking gun, that would be of utmost interest. Following is the list: 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 I would personally doubt that every single one of those is actually a sockpuppet, but I only seek the yes or no answer to that one question (barring a smoking gun(s) of some kind), nothing that is especially useful to anybody for anything other than confirming or quelling suspicions of sockpuppetry.

 It's known that this guy killed around 3,000 indigenan in Litoral of Brazil when arrived. He is a killer and is a hero in Portugal. Since Cabral arrived here, we Brazilians have been killed by Portuguese culture of exploration and denegration. 

 This is a LIE. 

 TRUE: The Discovery of Brazil - a week in the region Bahia(almost 10-11 days), Porto Seguro, Cabralia etc. (before the fleet set sail to the Cape and to India in Asia) was the most peacefull week of the history of European discoveries, without any dead, Native or Portuguese; Natives spend a night in the ships, they dance with Portuguese men, aid the portuguese made a huge Cross, watch the two Mass, the rituals. A unique moment of paradise in history. 
 If donÂ´t know nothing about history, please avoid stupid comments. 

 :The typical Brazilian speech: """"It's Cabral's fault"""". Come on, you achieved independence 200 years ago, stop blaming the Portuguese.   

 *On a more sober note, I feel we might tone down the repeated """"discovery"""" talk of places where people had been living for thousands of years. Lets talk about sex.   

 I agree with you . I mean, come on!!!!!!!!!  Brazil has independence for about 200 years now and theyÂ´re still saying that its CabralÂ´s or the Portuguese fault??!! For God sake, do something with your country and stop blaming others! When Portugal achieved independency (and we did it by our hands, we didnÂ´t need a king from other country to say it for us) did the Portuguese cry for 200 years saying that the Castilians or Moors had ruin their country? NO!!! We transformed it in the biggest discoverer of its times (maybe of all times!). You have a great sunny country, and you say you are a happy people, what more do you whant? Your country is huge (thanks to us). The spanish conquistadores didnÂ´t dezimated your tribes (because we, not them, colonized you, and we were much nicer that the spanish conquistadores. Just ask to the Aztecs, Incas, Maias...ho wait, you canÂ´t, they were dezimated. Too bad, now you canÂ´t see how the spanish were much nicer than the portuguese, as some brazilians think. Now seriously, I really think its a shame what happent to those tribes, and iÂ´m just using Spain has an exemple, I like Spain, great country.). So stop blaming us, and do something for your country. IÂ´m sure that he deserves that you do something for him. 

 * The portuguese gave you the fifth biggest country in the world. Half of South America. What are you personally doing to improve the unjust society you are living on? The uncapacity shown in every leader you had until today? Are you going to blame the portuguese for the lack of proper and decent gorvernment you have been having for the last two centuries (200 years itÂ´s a long time!)? What Brasil needs is to organize themselves and work seriously. Stop the street crime and abductions. Stop hunger, lack of education, unemployment and death at birth. Create a just society and be productive. You can't carry on being the country of the three S: Sex, Samba and Soccer. ItÂ´s easy to blame the others while sitting and doing absolutely nothing to improve your quality of life. 

 """"It's known that this guy killed around 3,000 indigenan in Litoral of Brazil when arrived. He is a killer and is a hero in Portugal. Since Cabral arrived here, we Brazilians have been killed by Portuguese culture of exploration and denegration."""" 

 All this is no more than a hilarious lie. There is no such evidence at all. Cabral and his crew didn't kill any native Indians when they spent a week at Porto Seguro. It is true that Portuguese colonists later killed many Indians, but not Cabral. People who make such ignorant statements besmirch the reputation of Wikipedia.

 I believe the general description of """"knock"""" refers to the sound: engines subject to """"knock"""" make a lot of noise. Traditionally defined, """"knock"""" is brought about by ignition of the fuel/air charge prior to TDC of the piston, however that happens. Whenever it happens, rapidly expanding, burning charge encounters a piston that is still moving toward TDC as a function of the momentum imparted by the crank and flywheel. This causes a confrontation between the rising piston/crank/flywheel assembly and the expanding charge wishing to drive the piston down; hence lots of things are driven into each other when they don't want to be, and noise and wear and damage result. Knocking, or pinging/pinking, can commonly happen in a spark-ignited crank piston engine when the timing is too far advanced, even though detonation does not occur. 

 """"Detonation"""" essentially refers to things burning really fast, such that there is no flame front, or essentially no flame front. It happens in HCCI, and in """"engine run-on"""" when ignition in a very hot crank-piston engine is turned off, especially when running on low-octane fuel. HCCI engines are often referred to as """"knock engines"""" although they are actually not so, according to the definition above. That is, HCCI engines really do detonate, in that pretty much all of the micro-droplets of fuel in a homogeneous mixture combust nearly simultaneously, which is more than can be said for either SI or CIDI engines. But they do not """"knock"""" unless this detonation happens prior to TDC. Actually, though, recall that knock as defined above really just means making a lot of noise. According to this definition, crank-piston HCCI engines also """"knock,"""" because, even when spontaneous ignition happens exactly at TDC (which it hardly ever does, by the way), the high peak pressures and energy release rates of HCCI tend to hammer the piston against connecting rod and crank, even when they are already moving downwards. They are simply not moving downward """"fast enough,"""" such that the piston is driven downward faster than it would """"like"""" to be, thus again creating lots of wear and making lots of noise.  

 So get rid of the connecting rod and crank. Now, if the thing still detonates, which it will, on an HCCI model, as long as the charge is homogeneous and the compression pressure is sufficient to initiate spontaneous combustion, you have an engine running on detonation alone, without the phenomenon of """"knock."""" I.e., run a double-acting free-piston HCCI engine and there is no such thing as knock, but lots of such thing as detonation. Run it as rich as you want as rich as stoich will let you. It doesn't make lots of  noise, because there are no connecting rods and no crank to oppose the piston motion. It wants to move extremely rapidly in a direction opposite to that which caused the compression; OK, go for it. There's nothing stopping you. No noise, no knock. Total detonation. It has been built in the past, and it worked exactly as described. It is presently being built again, and it will once again work exactly as described. It's exactly the same thing as a pulse-detonation jet engine, only smarter and incomparably cheaper and more reliable. So there. No references; don't need 'em. References are for people who don't have confidence in what they are talking about. I am not one of those people.

 :: It is only me and you involved in this conflict, so I find it better to sort this matter here. When you have the time, please reply. It would be conveniant to reply on . Thank you.   

 :::It's not just you and me; editors such as Silver Edge and Theaveng also involved themselves in making changes to the statements in question. Even if we were the only two editors currently engaged in the dispute, to me this is not a personal matter of conduct or opinion, but a discussion of article content, in which other editors should be free and encouraged to participate. It is article-relevant, and not the first time there has been reverts regarding this sort of content. To address your specific points, though: 
 :::Live blogs are often imprecise about the things they cover, as the reporters rush to get the information out as soon as they happen. Sometimes they get the details wrong. I'm not saying that is the case here. I already mentioned that executives often play loose with the terminology when proclaiming figures, even if there is a slide presentation with graphs. I haven't seen the graphs, so if you could show me some that you believe support your case, please point me to them. 
 :::Corporate press releases, on the other hand, are usually much more precise in what they claim, being very deliberate in their word choices. The particular press release I cited was released almost immediately after the keynote, indicating that it was probably prepared before Hirai even made his speech. I suspect it may even have been prepared with the same notes Hirai used for his keynote. As for the whether a statement that """"over 120 million PS2 units shipped worldwide as of September 20, 2007"""" is incorrect; it can be somewhat misleading in that it may imply a stronger connection between the figure and the date than is actually the case, but to say that is incorrect is pushing the limits of literalism, in my opinion. Especially when you are trying to make an argument that as many consoles had been sold already by that date. All the links you've provided point to articles that are casually-worded. The Tiscali article was written July 16. 
 :::Sony only changed to reporting consumer sales figures with its first quarter of fiscal 2007, and even then, its internal data only goes back to fiscal 2006. Before that, the internal sales figures it reported were always for production shipments. This particular dispute reminds me of several other sales figures disputes, particularly this one regarding PlayStation 3 sales. You may wish to review that for some background. 
 :::These aren't the only issues I have with the statements, but I'm serious about my preference that this discussion take place in the article talk page. We can discuss my reasons why here, but I would request that any further comments regarding PlayStation 2 article content be made in an article talk page thread.

 ==Chak De GAN== 
 Hi Dwaipayanc - How's everything? I know you are on break but I thought I'd let you know that I've nominated Chak De India for WP:GAN. To do so, I had to significantly reduce the plot which was about 1000 words over the normal limit of 900 words. I think that this is potentially both a GA and FA article. -   
 :Hi! How are you? Yes I noticed in my watchlist that Chak De was in GAN. Unfortunately i do not have the time to go through the article properly. It seemed the lead is short.    
 ::All is well, just going back to some articles that seem to have potential. I understand about time, no pressure...When you do have a moment, if you could tell me what the lead needs to make it stronger, I would appreciate it. Good to hear from you, -   
 :::IMO, two sentences on the plot would be nice in the lead. Also, the real life inspiration for the film may be added. These two aspects will be good for the second paragraph of the lead. The third paragraph of the lead may contain the box office and critical and award success. The Margaret Herrick library factoid in the lead seems unnecessary (although I have no idea how prestigious that is). 
 :::At present the last sentence of teh first para of the leads reads ,""""..Khan and Chak De girls"""". I think it would be better to explain the """"Chak De"""" girls here (eg, the players that the coach handpicked to play... etc).   
 ::::Thanks!!  Let me think about these points and I'll let you know when I've revised the intro. -   

 I re-wrote the lead. When you have a free moment, could you take a look? Make any changes that you feel are necessary or let me know on my talk page what can be improved. Thanks so much, -   

 :EXCELLENT! How about adding in the plot return of Khan to his ancestral home head held high at the end of the movie?   

 ::Ok, I made the changes. Take a look and let me know what you think. Also, the article is seriously in need of free images but I can't seem to find any - not even of SRK. If you have thoughts or ideas, let me know. -

 == Good Article Review == 

 This is well done and nearly to good article status, however there are a few issues that need to be addressed first, so I am putitng it on hold. You have seven days to fix these (and they should all be pretty easy / quick fixes). I will check back in two days to see how it is going and am glad to try and answer any questions you have  - ask here or on my talk page. Nice work so far! 

 Manual of style issues: 
 *There should be a non-breaking space Â  between numbers and their units. I have fixed two as an example.  
 *I would make sure metric and imperial units correspond - for example, in Reference 24, currently meters are compared to miles (""""800 metres (0.5 mi)""""). I would either compare meters to feet or use kilometers (0.8 kilometres (0.5 mi)).  
 *For the """"See also"""" section, quoting Wikipedia:See_also#See_also """"a good rule of thumb is that it should not repeat links already present in the article."""" So many of the links currently in the See also section should not be included (but you could add Mrs. Chippy ;-) ). 
 *I also think that the Headers should not repeat the article title if possible, so Quest Expedition and Shackleton's death (1921â22) might be better as Quest Expedition and death (1921â22). See Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style#Section_headings (Avoid restating or directly referring to the topic ). 
 *Please make the spelling of English words consistent with British spelling, since the subject of the article was British. Examples include: honor (A) (British: honour), metre (B) (American: meter), organise (B) (American: organize), recognize (A) (British: recognise), realise (B) (American: realize), ization (A) (British: isation), traveled (A) (British: travelled). (This suggestion is adapted from the semi-automated peer review script) 

 General issues: 
 *The first two sentences in Childhood seem awkward. Instead of """"Shackleton was of English-Irish ancestry and born in Kilkea, County Kildare, Ireland on February 15, 1874, about 48 kilometres (30 mi) from Dublin. Ernest was second of ten children and first of two sons in a family led by father Henry and mother Henrietta Sophia Gaven"""" How about something like """"Shackleton was born on February 15, 1874, in Kilkea, County Kildare, Ireland, about 48 kilometres (30 mi) from Dublin. Ernest's father Henry and mother Henrietta Sophia Gaven were of of English-Irish ancestry - he was the second of their ten children, and first of two sons."""" instead? 
 *Same secton, """"Four years later, the family moved from Ireland to Sydenham in suburban London because of the assassination of Lord Frederick Cavendish and the better income opportunity."""" W0uld it make sense to say why the assasination led to their move (presumably as """"English-Irish""""?). Also wouldn't """"opportunity for better income"""" read better? 
 *I tend to think of college as something primarily for 18 to 22 year old students, so I would add his ages while enrolled in Dulwich College (since he was done by age 16 to join the merchant marine (shouldn't this be wikilinked - OK, not sure a redirect to ship transport is that helpful?). 
 *Try to attribute """"suggestions"""" in the text, so in the Discovery section, """"It has been suggested that Scott resented Shackleton's popularity..."""" might be better as """"Huntford has suggested that Scott resented...''"""". There are several similar instances to look at. 
 *Please clarify in the Interim section what Beardmore was the owner of (tobacoo company? the mill? both?). """"Concomitantly, Shackleton prepared for another expedition to the Antarctic by raising funds and thus was active in business ventures such as a tobacco company and as a mill promoter. The owner, William Beardmore was impressed..."""" 
 *Nice pictures and generally good captions. Can you add dates to the first two pictures of Shacleton and the one of his wife? Also would the caption """"Working to free the ship"""" be better as """"Working to free the Endurance""""? Some of the pictures are very small (this one, launching the James Caird..) - might want to make all thumb size. 

 Suggestions (not needed for Good Article, but helpful, especially if you are going for FA later): 
 *Since this is a biography article, please add , see WP:PDATA. 
 *I would see if you could get a map of Antarctica showing places mentioned here. 

 I hope this helps - great article in general and these are minor points to make it meet GA criteria.   '''' """

 === Exegetics is not """"special pleading"""" === 

 """"I've reverted... special pleading"""", says Mel Etitis. So simple to disregard more than ten paragraphs where I talk about the disciplines of exegetics and hermenutics. What has been reverted? 
 * An interpretation of a narrative text about Noah. Narrative texts, especially in the Genesis, do not claim that the actions of the people automatically should be considered as God's will. on the contrary. Even if Noah """"institutionalised"""" slavery (very much disputed) that can in no way be taken as an indication that this was a good thing to do. One needs corroborating texts to make such a claim. Remove this hermenutical principle and the Bible says absolutely everything. 
 To prove the point that I am wrong, please state what exegetical and hermeneutical principles you follow in order to substantiate the following: """"In this way slavery appears to be not only sanctioned but institutionalized by Noah."""" 
 * """"The apostle Paul never explicitly addressess the issue of slavery as an institution."""" Please provide a text where st Paul addresses the institution of slavery, where his topic is if slavery should be abolished in society or not. My claim was that he addressess the topic of how a special group of people should conduct themselves in a society where slavery is everywhere. This is no """"special pleading"""" but a simple fact. 
 What one should make from the fact that the institution is not addressed is another step, namely in constructing a christian ethic. I am discussing exegetics. 
 * """"In his context however, this principle did not lead to any agitation for the abolishment of slavery per se."""" is reverted to """"Yet, Paul never takes this to the stage of calling for the abolition of slavery."""" The word yet speaks volumes and is in itself definately more POV than my phrase. My phrase is nothing but a very simple stating of facts. It does not condone st Paul, nor explain why he chose his topic. It simply says he did not argue that slavery as an institution should be dropped (just as he never argues the opposite either). 
 * """"Present-day Christians argue ... And that early christianity did not have a poltical voice, but was often trying to survive in the face of hostility and persecution. They would also argue that as soon as christianity became a more dominant factor in society it mostly have stood for the abolishment of slavery, as is evidenced when it overtook belief in the Ãsir gods."""" In this paragraph we address the issue of how present day christians look at the passages in Scripture and what guiding principles they follow when the claim that Christianity is anti-slavery. That is the topic. To deny the very voicing of these arguments in such a context is offensive. Should it be considered OK if a christian went to the article on ateism and simply removed the arguments that ateists have? Of course not. 

 Before anyone reverts once again, I would  appreciate some exegetics and some hermeneutics! 

 Mel Etitis also makes the following claim that I make """"the true but irrelevant point that slavery is seen as being a dreadful state for the enslaved"""" (emphasis added). Nonsense. The topic at hand is how did the biblical authors regard slavery. When something in the bible is considered a curse that is not simply another way of saying that someone had an unpleasant experience. It speaks volumes about how God regards something. 

 Noah cursed on of his sons. That is in no way a comparable act with issuing a law. When the people of Israel disobey God, they face the possibility of being taken as slaves by other people. That is a consequence of not fulfilling the Covenant with God, something God especially pleads with the people that they should in every way avoid.

 In """"The Soulforge"""" by Margaret Weis (and this is an uber quick summary) it is revealed that Raistlin (R) had made a deal with Fistandantilus (F) to complete the Test, reneged on it, but then F was able to put his """"soul"""" (for lack of a better term at the moment) inside R's body. In the """"Dragonlance Legends"""" series (Weis and Hickman) R goes back in time to learn the rest of F's secrets, and they have a magic battle. While the victor is considered to be R, and goes by R, he actually possesses the memories/abilities of both, and they both had the desire to become a god by destroying Takhisis,  so it is unclear which one actually survived the battle. So, with the lack of clear evidence, it is a Schrodinger's Cat situation. By which I mean that, from that point in the storyline, R can be seen as both R AND F, even though they started out as two different people. (Oh, and quick side note, Raistlin's staff was not F's, it was the Staff of Magius)

ac5ce0508bb3ba96,""" 

 I am appalled that this page has been listed on votes for deletion.  It is a very nicely written  even if stubby  article on a topic of importance in scientific inference.   
 :Likewise, but not surprised, anymore.    
 ::Guys, don't you know in America the word """"relationship"""" means something else? Doubtless, a relationship based only on ice cream is spurious, and hence the article was a tautology.   

 What is the difference between spurious variables and antecedent variables? I can't tell from the article.   

 I can't tell either.  I'm editing the article appropriately.    

 """"Confounding variable"""" is redirected to this article, but """"confounding factor"""" has its own stub article that contains essentially only the ice cream example and links to two other articles, one of which is this.  Shouldn't confounding factor be redirected here also, and that stub be deleted?    
 *I say no: I came to this page looking for an explanation of confounding variables. Thankfully, I found the link to the confounding factor page, which gave me what I needed. Confounding variables are an important topic in experimental design, and simply redirecting the page here is misleading. I've redirected confounding variable to confounding factor, added the stats-stub tag to confounding factor, and added a mention of experimental design to it. -  

 ==Error in this Article== 

 Hey, this isn't right, could someone fix it?  From the article: 

 > In practice, three conditions must be met in order to conclude that X causes Y, directly or indirectly: 
 >     * X must precede Y 
 >     * Y must not occur when X does not occur 
 >     * Y must occur whenever X occurs 

 > Spurious relationships can often be identified by considering whether any of these three conditions have been violated. 

 > The final condition may be relaxed in the case of indirect causation.  

 Now rain (X) may cause me to stay in (Y); that is, I stay in whenever it rains, but I may stay in when it doesn't rain (because it may be snowing, for example).  So clearly there are obvious cases when the second condition may be relaxed, rather than the third. 

 In fact, the example of the pistol shot causing the death of the man doesn't even work, as the guy could die from a metiorite, thus violating the second condition, or he could be kept alive by the doctor, thus violating the third.   

 The only condition that seems to be really relevant is the first. 

 So, what was actually meant here?? 

 :I agree. """"Y must not occur when X does not occur"""" is wrong. It's not necessary for Y to have only one possible cause.    

 ::I added an exception to the second condition covering this objection. I also added a second exception to the third condition and a note that the the conditions are necessary to prove causation but not sufficient. I may have gone a bit off-topic on the latter.    

 == Combine """"Spurious Relationship"""" and """"Joint Effect"""" == 

 I would agree that this should be combined with """"Spurious Relationship"""", as this page only recites a different version (with a few extra comments) on the ice cream example mentioned in """"Spurious Relationship: General Example"""". It might also work to change """"General Example"""" to """"Joint Effect"""", and insert the text from """"Joint Effect"""" in its place. 

 Retrieved from """"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Joint_effect"""" 

 I took the step of deleting the redundant text in """"joint effect"""" and redirecting to this entry. - Aug 28 2006

His followers and the organizations he founded are involved in many service projects around the world. They provide free education through schools, free healthcare through two state-of-the-art hospitals in Puttaparthi and Bangalore and two water projects serving millions in the Indian states of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.  Puttaparthi, where Baba was born and still lives, was originally a small village where one can now find an extensive University complex, a World-Religions Museum (Chaitanya Jyoti), a Planetarium, a railway station, an airport and more. High ranking Indian politicians, like the current President Dr. Abdul Kalam, Manmohan Singh (Former finance minister and current Prime Minister), and Atal Vajpayee (Former Prime minister) have been official guests at the ashram in Puttaparthi. 

 Sathya Narayana Raju was born into a poor agrarian family in the remote village of Puttaparthi located in Anantapur district, Andhra Pradesh. In the 1940s he proclaimed himself to be the reincarnation of Shirdi Sai Baba and subsequently took the fakir's name. Sathya Sai Baba claims that he is the second in a series of three Avatars (incarnations) of Shiva Shakti, the future incarnation being Prema Sai Baba.Gurupournima Day, 6 July 1963, Sathya Sai Baba, Sathya Sai Speaks III 5, 19., Available onlineInterview given by Sathya Sai Baba to R.K.

Sathya Sai Baba teaches the unity of all major world religions and says that they all lead to God. He preaches a foundation of five basic human values: Truth, Right Conduct, Peace, Love and Non-Violence. 

 Sathya Sai Baba's followers report many, sometimes spectacular, miracles of various kinds which they attribute to him. He is observed to allegedly manifest vibuthi (holy ash) and small objects (rings, necklaces and watches) daily. Sathya Sai Baba explained the phenomenon of manifestation as an act of divine creation, but refused to have his materializations investigated under experiment"

 == Suggesting information to add == 

 As you can see above, I work for ARI and it was based on discussion of my redirect request that this page has now been renamed to """"Autism Research Institute"""". Now that the page focuses on ARI, it seems like it would be helpful for there to be more information on what ARI actually is and does. Especially in the first line of the article, should this not be a description of what the organization is rather than stating something that it created?  

 Since it's best for me not to edit the article myself, here are a few initial suggestions for others to add. I've included links to sources to support each point: 

 *Autism Research Institute is a 501(c) organization focused on research to improve quality of life for adults and children with autism spectrum disorders. 

 *The organization was founded in 1967 by Bernard Rimland, PhD   

 *ARI collaborates with organizations including Autism Speaks to provide continuing education on adult support issues, though its Autistic Global Initiative.  

 *The organization has also collaborated with The Cleveland Clinic Center for Continuing Medical Education on autism spectrum disorders. 

 *Along with the Blazeman Foundation for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) research, ARI co-funds the National Institute of Childhood Health and Human Development's Brain and Tissue Bank at the University of Maryland School of Medicine

ba2c2de06bf2f867,"""::I agree: There is no MBR on an unpartitioned PC medium such as a floppy disk, only a VBR.  The view that a floppy has both and they are one and the same is interesting but unconventional; I have been hacking on IBM compatibles since the XT era, before hard disks were standard equipmentâand before I knew I was hackingâand this is the first I've heard that perception.  Historically, it goes against the fact that the MBR was invented as a surrogate VBR to get multiple volumes of the exact format that was conventional on unpartitioned media onto a single fixed disk (which was too large, at 20+ MB, to conveniently contain just one volume of the typical FAT16 [32 MB-limited, MS-DOS 2.0â3.2 ] type).  Since in the beginning there was no MBR, it is unhistorical to say the floppy disk's VBR was also an MBR.  However, that said, viewing things from a different perspective, """"out of the box"""", can lead to useful insights that can ultimately lead to creative and sometimes even exciting new engineering ideas and solutions, so I want to express my respect for the thought and don't want to discourage unconventional thinking.  Despite its possible intellectual value, I just want to affirm that this particular description of the relationship between MBRs, VBRs, and floopy disks is not encyclopedic. 
 ::I also note that the distinction between MBR and VBR is at an abstract  software level above the BIOS.  I have just tonight added a clear exposition of this to the article, in the Programing Considerations section.  To BIOS, there are no MBRs or VBRs, only generic boot records which it loads, checks, and runs, giving them full control.  Based on this point, as for the ability of the MBR to function as a VBR conventionally does as well, I think it's absolutely possible.  The assertion that an MBR or VBR directly loaded by the BIOS boot loader can do anything clearly implies this.  The only special technique needed would be for the boot record, when behaving as an MBR, to pass some signal to the VBR which it itself could use to detect that it was being called as a VBR (i.e. by an MBR) and not as an MBR, or for it when acting as an MBR to detect when the VBR was itself and to then jump to its VBR entry offset (not at 0) instead of its MBR entry address (at 0).  Doing either of these is trivial and many methods are obvious.  (Therefore, there is no need for it to be explained in the article, even if it were established published work).

 ==Please Dumb It Down!== 

 It's fantastic that all this info is here, but it's total gibberish. I don't know how many non-experts look at this, but lots of it is of that caliber. Maybe it should have sub-articles for the specifics of things like economics and chemistry. There should at least be better organized paragraphs and sections that follow the mechanics of writing, unlike that neat etymology of """"acid test"""" in the introduction. Lots of the hard science needs explaining, too. These improvements would make wikipedia much more enjoyable for casual users. 

 p.s. I was just trying to find out why gold doesn't easily corrode/ tarnish. Can anyone explain? 

 == Amount of Gold == 

 This article states that all the gold ever produced would fit into a cube, with a volume of 8000 m3. At a density of 19,300 kg/m3, this gives a total gold supply of 1500 tonnes, approximately. Later in the article the world supply of gold is said to be over 3000 tonnes. Why the discrepancy?  âPreceding unsigned comment added by     

 :Could be that one thing is """"all the gold ever produced"""" (1500 tonnes) and another is the total amount of gold on Earth that can be reasonably extracted? Just guessing.    

 with 8000 m3 the total production would be close to 150,000 tonnes. this is the figure that the world gold council gives as its estimate for total production up to 2001.  âPreceding unsigned comment added by

 Hello, 
 I noticed some of your comments on the discussion page for Gyspy Rose Lee, and I was hoping you'd respond to some of my comments. I think there is some room to doubt the commonly accepted story of Gypsy's involvement in the G-String Murders (that it was completely ghost-written). Thank you. As I mentioned there, the book """"February House"""" digs up some great research (which apparently is right out in the open) to describe the many months Gypsy spent honing her writing skills (exposing herself to the proper influences), typing, creating pages of notes, having chapters revised and proofread and hiring assistants - most of this under the tutelage of her childhood friend, the former Harper's Bazaar literary editor, George Davis. Whatever work Rice may or may not have had done most certainly came after Gypsy had written many of the chapters on her own. One fascinating anecdote she wrote of in a letter was when she submitted a finished chapter to her editor who then asked her what had happened to a vital character. She described the whole process as a learning experience. Hopefully, the article itself can be changed to reflect this.

 The problem with the """"old Wilczekian field"""" is that it's designed in  many books as a digital chessboard, built by stable """"n""""-dimensional equal squares, or mono-dimesinal equal squares due to the """"holographic principle"""" (the same result, but the """"holographic principle"""" is were data are kept, the n-dimensional projection is simply a projection). 

 All the above are correct except the fact that """"chromodynamic noise"""" is a form of """"noise"""", thus the """"noise grains"""" are """"not continuous"""" and """"not of stable characteristics if relativistically examined (we can probe only in a relativistic manner though)"""" but their (noise grains) characteristics are both """"brobabilistic""""(inside a wavefunctional permissible range) and """"relativistic""""(the other interacting grain particles cause the """"dynamic range"""" of these grains to vary) 

  
 """"Noise grains"""" are the product of random fluctuation of the """"grid"""" (""""noise grains"""" are the """"grid""""). We can apply """"number theory""""(pure mathematics) because each """"grain"""" alone is an """"integer digit"""". If relativistically examined via """"combinatorics"""" as a part of a """"noise set"""" each grain """"contibutes"""" to the overall """"grid"""". Even though each """"grain"""" is an """"integer digit"""" when we probe that set via collisions, we will distort it's original properties. 

 The """"Nyquist frequency"""" or """"Planck frequency""""(same thing) of the """"grid""""(""""chromodynamic noise grains""""), is half of the sampling rate of a """"discrete signal"""" processing system. The """"grid"""" is not a digitally quantized system, thus the """"discrete signal"""" of the """"grid""""(void field or noise field) is both """"probabilistic"""" and """"relativistic"""" in a manner I proclaimed above. 

 All particles are """"shifting statistics"""" or """"wavefunctions"""" or """"waves"""". Particles don't cause the """"noise grid"""" to """"shift"""", only the """"statistics of the grid"""" do """"shift"""". 
 """"Wavefunction"""" means """"Shifting statistics of the chromodynamic noise grid"""". 

 A """"Hilbert curve"""" (also known as a Hilbert space-filling curve) is a """"continuous"""" fractal space-filling curve. """"Ideal particles"""" or """"long-lasting particles"""" tend to look like """"Hilbert curves"""", an organized """"noise pattern of the grid that statistically makes apparent a particle"""". 

 """"Particle"""" = """"Hilbert curve"""" of the """"noise grid"""". 
 In nature though, no particle is perfect, thus we need to evolve a """"non-continuous"""" fractal space-filling fragmented curve(s) diffusion.

Further, you provided no reference to back up your change. In the future please do so. Much thanks!"

Comparisons to the KÃ¶nigstiger should take into account however that the older German vehicle was grossly underpowered; the Leopard 2 isn't. Also there have been all kinds of technical improvements since 1945 resulting in tanks that are, even at 70 tons, in practice far more reliable than any tank in WWII, whatever its weight. Yes, modern tanks have their weak spots that even a RPG-7 â preferably not with a tandem charge: that's really only useful for defeating ERA â can exploit. Protecting them completely would make them too expensive. Is that a serious liability? The answer depends on what you want to use them for. If you desire to defeat a technologically advanced enemy, heavy tanks are still very useful. Other tanks are then the main opponents. If you expect to wage urban warfare only, tanks should be a great deal lighter. But not so light as a LAV: light armour is much too vulnerable to serious resistance. So the 40 ton class would indeed be best. However both the M1 and the Leopard 2 can easily be turned into 45 ton RPG-proof vehicles by simply replacing the heavy armour modules with a configuration consisting only of two silicon carbide layers or something equivalent. In fact Australia apparently plans to do just that with its M1's. And in case of real war they are just as easily made real tanks again."

(3) theoretically yes, the people of Taiwan in 1945 had choice to announce the independence according to the UN Charter. But there were no any evidence shows that the peoples on the Taiwan, Penghu islands proclaimed the independence officially as a new national or state before the ROC and Japan signed the Treaty of Taipei in 1952, that means most of them chose the right to be a citizen of ROC and they did. (4) the Treaty of Taipei also says that (A.) - ARTICLE II. It is recognized that under Article 2 of the Treaty of Peace with Japan signed at the city of San Francisco in the United States of America on September 8, 1951 (hereinafter referred to as the San Francisco Treaty), Japan has renounced all right, title and claim to Taiwan (Formosa) and Penghu (the Pescadores) as well as the Spratly Islands and the Paracel Islands.; (B.) - ....In regard to the Treaty of Peace between Japan and the Republic of China signed this day, I have the honor to refer, on behalf of my Government, to the understanding reached between us that the terms of the present Treaty shall, in respect of the Republic of China, be applicable to all the territories which are now, or which may hereafter be, under the control of its Government...., this means clearly ROC holds the territory of Taiwan, Penghu islands.

 IMO this page needs a complete refactor. It is too long (61KB), the headings are vague (or have discussed it, other countries), the information repetitive and poorly focussed. 

 It should have a clearly marked section for countries that have initiated phase out by closing at least one plant (or in one case never opening it!), and another for countries that are committed in some way, for example having an act of parliament that forbids construction of new nuclear power plants. 

 It's hard to know what to say about other countries, but there's no call for example for a detailed history of nuclear power in the USA, that should go elsewhere, perhaps in an article Nuclear technology in the United States to match Category:Nuclear technology in the United States. Putting this material here creates the impression that the USA has in some way initiated phase-out, which is simply not true, although their once clear lead in this technology has been substantially reduced over the last few decades. 

 We should probably have a paragraph on New Zealand, which is widely and falsely believed to have an act of parliament banning nuclear power. Whether we should even mention countries such as France, China and Japan who are currently installing new capacity I'm inclined to doubt; This information is probably better in a separate article.  

 Nor should a country be listed here simply because one or more of its minority parties have opposed nuclear power; This has probably occurred in all countries if we look hard enough. 

 This article has improved a lot, but more is needed. Comments on the above proposals welcome."

 You removed the Baltimore Ravens logo (and reverted to an old INCORRECT logo that I had corrected) on the grounds that it was """"to [sic] big for non free"""".  I can only assume you're talking about the image's dimensions, rather than the file size on disk since I'm well below Wikipedia's maximum file size.  However, I'm not sure I understand this reasoning, because vector graphics don't have a """"size"""" in the same sense that traditional raster graphics do.  I agree with you (and Wikipedia) that raster image formats (JPG, PNG, TIFF, etc.) used under a fair use rationale need to be limited in size to prevent abuse and copyright infringement.  However I can't find any guidance on Wikipedia on the size of vector images, other than they should not be rendered any larger than necessary (the important word there is RENDER).  How large users choose to render vector graphics is beyond the control of myself or Wikipedia; it's like telling someone how many copies of an article they can print.  We can't control that.  It's the RENDERING of a vector graphic that's at issue, not the graphic itself, since an SVG is no more than geometric instructions on how to render a final raster image, NOT the raster image itself.  Hence, when referencing an SVG, """"too big"""" is not a valid descriptor. 

 Nevertheless, I went ahead and """"re-sized"""" the image to be more in line with pixel dimensions that would be appropriate for raster images.  I hope this is satisfactory.  Happy Holidays!

The left battalion, unaware that its support on the left had been delayed, veered north to try to make contact near Lumm Farm which tok the battalion across the Wambeke spur instead of straight down. The Oosttaverne Line was easily reached but on the Wambeek brook, 1,000 yards north of the intended position. The Auatralians extended their line further north to Polka Estaminet trying to meet the 33rd Brigade. The brigade arrived at 4:30 p.m. with four tanks and took Joye and Van Hove Farms beyond the objective to silence German machine-guns there. 

 On the IX Corps front a brigade from the 11th Division was ordered to advance to Vandamme Farm at 9:25 a.m. but the mesage was delayed and the troops did not reach the assembly area at Rommens Farm until 3:50 p.m., half an hour late. To cover the delay the corps commander ordered the reserve brigade of the 19th Division to take the Oosttaverne Line from from Van Hove Farm-Oosttaverne village-Bug Wood so that only the southern 1,200 yards of the objective was left for the 33rd Brigade. These orders were also delayed and the 19th Division commander asked for a postponement then ordered the 57th Brigade to advance without waiting for the 33rd Brigade. The troops only knew that they were to advance downhill and keep up to the barrage but were able to occupy the objective in 20 minutes against light opposition, meeting the Australians at Polka Estaminet. 

 Two brigades of the 24th Division advanced into the  X Corps sector and reached Damm Strasse on time. The brigades reached their objectives easily around Bug Wood, Rose Wood and Verhaest Farm, tanking many German pillboxes unopposed. 289 Germans and six field guns were captured for a loss of six casualties in an 800 yards advance along the Roozebeek valley. Ravine Wood on the left was also taken unopposed and the extreme left of the advance was drawn back to meet the 47th Division which was still held up by machine-gun fire from the Spoil Bank. The final objective had been taken except for the area of the Comines canal near the Spoil Bank and 1,000 yards of the Oosttaverne Line between the II Anzac Corps and IX Corps."

Like a radio-controlled car as a power source?  Well guess what, they can!  They are called RCVs or Radio-controlled vehicles and their only power source is attenas with a small lithium battery.  However the radiation levels of the att are collected and multiplied via other att with a high neg reading.  The more atts, the higher the voltage. Here's how it works..the att wire goes from a high radiation level to another att wire and small iridium magnets, its end of the secondary att is rerouted to a lithium power cell.  The more atts the higher the voltage! The best thing about it is it can completly replace a battery or evidence of one.  Some day maybe you will even have this energy or evidence of it."

 They are thirsty with human resources. Ghost means that an existence stretching out a promise with natural high sight. Why? is it an evil or a devil? But it's somewhat different from Natural opposite side together with natural beginning. Ghosts can be evils. But they have plans with a harmonized returned condition because of God & Jesus christ or angels. They should provoke humans for their plans. Sometimes, they are arrogant, or intelligent, or nasty, or a tray-searcher to reach out a target. They also knew the Bible, so they're in the globe, and they should use the Bible because of the way for a harmonized returned condition if they should surrender. If they don't surrender, they also can be crawl or let the target person in suffering. They knew historically the way of persons, so they can return the socially harmonized condition. Ghost couldn't be known from what. But I can explain the condition as concepts. They can be evils or devils or natural purity or elfs or natural functions or desirable confusing. So, what I am saying, we can have the conceptual explanation into the Ghost. They can be an evil, but why can it be the existence stretching out a promise with even natural high sight? Because if God does his way, all of everything even under heaven, would follow the way. Ghosts' vision could be led historically. So, so many hard times did they experience. They knew what is good for the flow of history. They sometimes scold a person with wisdom for more wiser condition. they sometimes let a person's tongue free for self-control. they sometimes let a person's humble condition if they want. They shout and shout if the hardtime could return. We can determine their identity into evils because of our short vision or short time of experiences. But If you are the side of God, they should return to nature. We're younger and younger persons than Ghosts. And their experiences sometimes could lead a person with continuously not outing from goodness of mind. Ghosts're existences.

442d41012f1d54df,"== The bible == 

 Firstly let me say that I am sorry to have to bother you. 

 Secondly, I wish to let you know that a recent VFD that you took part in has closed. The result was that 32 people voted to keep all individual bible verses as seperate articles, and 34 voted that they shouldn't (2 abstensions, and 3 votes for both). This is considered by standard policy not to be a consensus decision (although the closing admin stated that it was a consensus to keep them). 

 Thirdly, the subject has now been put to a survey, so that it may remain open until there is a clear consensus for what appears to be a difficult issue to resolve. You may wish to take part in this survey, and record a similar vote to the one you made at the VFD there. The survey is available at Wikipedia:Bible verses."

 Three Rivers is an interesting example of wikipedia's laws limitations.  The problem is, there is basically no published information on the subject, so almost anything added is going to be considered original and thus wrong.  In this way, we can't learn about Three Rivers simply because no one has published it.   

 I've lived in Three Rivers and my information is verifiable  but """"verify"""" here would mean calling the people and asking them if what i write is accurate. 

 So what's the solution to this?"""

Re Heaney, yeah, I saw this morning. Not to be callous in the face of a man's death, but my first thought was that my usual 30-second phone conversation with my father will be a solid 5 minutes this weekend because of this. The old man is mad for him, and rightly so. By old man I mean my father, not my scrotum, as I usually use the phrase. My scrotum is indifferent when it comes to poetry. And, for the record, I only read love letters from living people if they take the form of an elaborate priamel that culminates in praise of my old man. Â Â

 :::DungeonSiegeAddict...this is unnecessary. The article isn't here to make the editors from the wikia site or the .co site happy.

 1  Nor from thy Name dost thou degenerate,

 Hi, I hope you don't mind me jumping in like that on the arbitration talk page, but it was obvious that you were being joky but equally obvious that your words could have been read in the wrong way.

Hugo Winckler,Theodor NÃ¶ldeke, Eduard Meyer etc., were very fine sources in their day, but can't be used because they predate contemporary scholarship by more than a century. You can use them if you make a section surveying theories about their existence or not, though. Velikovsky reports most sources like this accurately (in my experience) but he is not RS. The bible refracts ancient legends coming from multiethnic traditions into an 'historical' narrative written in terms of theological patterns of thought. So even the verifiably historical elements are caught up in moralizing reworking (as is true of much ancient historiography and much modern journalism, for that matter). We cannot know whether the traditions re the Amalekites reflects a historical people or league of tribes: we can guess from the topology that they imbricate over the areas later associated with the Bedouin and, generally, Arabs. As the Arabs gain some ascendency (6th cent. BCE) the Amalekites disappear, and the authors who refer to the latter do so in mythifying terms, to create an image of an eternally inimical people. As such, we are there in the realm of theological myth, since no external testimonies are available to restore the lineaments of the Amalek tale to some form of recognizable historical reality."

Focus on the content and sources (and feel free to disagree about that!) but avoid speculating about other editors' ideology and motives, or employing inflammatory hyperbole as in this edit and others.

 Hi Gwen Gale, I've been having an arguement with another editor about including information about someone's statement which is not 100% accurate. It has been discussed by expert geneticists (which the person based his statement on) that identifying a person's ancestry is not 100% accurate still to date and the other editor continues to include the information when I had the proper sources stating the flaws in the person's statements about admixture. If they want to keep in the article fine but the way it is written it makes his statement appear golden and 100% accurate. So I've gotten tired of it because on other editors are getting involved and I included even more sources clearly indicating that DNA tests assessing admixture are not 100% accurate and even miss/can't identify recent ancestors. I'm trying my best not to get into an edit war but I'm so tired of seeing it in the article. It's in African American in the admixture section and he also removed everything pertaining to relations between Native Americans and African Americans but left information between European Americans and African Americans...so what am I so supposed to think about that?

 * """"but does not try to persuade them to leave the sex industry. The organization also supports women who wish to leave the sex industry"""" - suggest """"The organization supports women wishing to leave the industry, but does not directly persuade them to do so""""

 * """"it was based at Sandals Church in Riverside"""" - what is """"Riverside""""? 
 * """"that received much traffic and news coverage"""" - might be simpler to say """"much media coverage"""" - traffic could imply there were queues everywhere as people wanted to chat to them 
 * """" and based the organization at Central Christian Church"""" - worth mentioning the church was in nearby Henderson, Nevada not Las Vegas itself 
 * Per WP:BLPSOURCES, the quotations in the lead ought to be cited, even though it can normally be lax. 
 * """"or not explicitly encouraging strippers to stop stripping"""" - to avoid repetition, maybe """"or not explicitly encouraging sex industry workers to quit"""" would be better - presumably their message was for anyone in this industry generally 
 * I'm not sure the bit about RaÃ«lism is necessary for the lead, as its not directly about this organisation 

 ===Ideology=== 
 * """"began to engage with softcore pornographic models and call girls as well"""" - don't need """"as well"""" 
 * """"Grecco (2007), n.p"""" - this book source needs more information, ideally a page number so the fact can be easily verified 
 * """"Members often wear eyelash extensions, stiletto heels, skinny jeans, and skin-tight t-shirts"""" - the Daily Express is perhaps slightly more palatable than the Daily Mail but still generally not considered a suitable quality source for controversial BLPs and so this should be removed or toned down to something like """"Members shun conservative dress styles"""" (which is mentioned in the Observer source) 
 * Is WorldNetDaily a good enough source for BLPs like this? 
 * """"in the softcore and fetish genres"""" - softcore and fetish could be linked 
 * """"trample fetish specifically"""" - """"specifically"""" would sit better in front 
 * """"she converted to Christianity and eventually left the sex industry, although no one attempted to tell her about Jesus."""" - how do you convert to Christianity without hearing about Jesus first? 
 * """"a close friend of hers who was working as a stripper had died[7] of alcohol intoxication."""" - might be easier to put the two sources together at the end of the sentence. Also, the source specifically mentions alcoholism which is different to alcohol intoxication, implying there was a long term problem rather than an accident 
 * """"Veitch began to evangelize to strippers because she wished someone had evangelized to her"""" - to avoid repetition, could one of the """"evangelized""""s be changed to a different word? 
 * """"One of her clients was Lori Albee,[3] a housewife with two children and no experience with the sex industry"""" - per WP:BLP, why is having no experience with the sex industry important? 
 * """"Veitch told Albee about her friend who had died in loneliness and depression"""" - I think just """"had died"""" will do here 
 * """"Albee suggested that they start evangelizing to other strippers."""" - to avoid repetition, maybe """"contacting"""" instead of """"evangelizing"""" would be better 
 * Might be worth summarising why the other organisations except San Diego disappeared? 

 ===Riverside chapter=== 
 * """"On Good Friday in 2005"""" - suggest """"On March 25, 2005 (Good Friday)"""" 
 * """"Albee and six other women went to a strip club"""" - the source said """"adult entertainment club"""" which is subtly different?

 Is it true that this early (1994) Russell film was autobiographical? If so, it would explain his personality and his treatment of women. Whatever the case, moviegoers are free to express their support or opposition of Russell's directorial style and his movies at the box office (or video store). As a moviegoer I tend to judge a movie on its artistic merit, but, this time, my disdain for workplace bullies may make me boycott Russell's movies.

Although Window Managers (like Enlightenment) are the face of Linux they are not the operating system. Windows 8 and Windows RT are not binary compatible, indicating different operating systems. RT is a presentation interface running on top of Phone OS core whether CE or BREW etc. Wikipedia calls Linux an operating system because it has a bootable kernel and even without the Window Managers and presentation APIs boots to a usable command line. Still has shell. Windows 8 can also boot to a command line and Windows Server has Core Mode sans GUI. Still has Win32 subsystem.

 Kesha Rose Sebert (born March 1, 1987), (pronounced ) (formerly stylized as Ke$ha), is an American singer-songwriter and rapper. In 2005, at age 18, Kesha was signed to producer Dr. Luke's record label, Kemosabe Entertainment, and publishing company. Although an active musician since then, singing background vocals and writing songs for other artists, her breakthrough came in early 2009 after appearing on rapper Flo Rida's number-one single, """"Right Round"""", although she was uncredited. Her debut album, Animal, and her first extended play, Cannibal, were released in 2010. Kesha's irreverent music and image propelled her to immediate commercial success, with Animal debuting as the number-one album in the United States. She also achieved three number-one singles, """"Tik Tok"""", """"We R Who We R"""", and """"Timber"""", and a string of top ten hits from the album and its re-release. At the same time, she continued to write songs for other artists, including """"Till the World Ends"""" for Britney Spears. Warrior, her second studio album, was released in December 2012, spawning Kesha's eighth top-ten hit with """"Die Young"""". """"Tik Tok"""" is among the best-selling digital singles in history, selling over 14 million units internationally.

b117502cbc647666,""" 

 == A few thoughts == 

 Before even attempting to approach this subject, folks should consider a few things. 

 * Where do bite statistics come from? As in, expert analysis and DNA testing or """"by gum officer, it wuz one a them pit bullys!""""? 

 The CDC can collect """"statistics"""" all day but if the underlying data is provided by uninformed, untrained """"eye witnesses"""", it won't amount to a hill of beans. 

 * Hysteria really does happen.  

 Look up """"satanic ritual abuse"""" even here on Wikipedia. I remember when that flap came to my town. People totally up in arms about something for which there hasn't been a single shred of evidence. Lives were ruined, millions spent in cases such as the McMartin pre-school circus trial, and there simply was no """"there"""" there.  

 Far as dogs go, I'm old enough to remember when The Big Scary Bad Dog That'll Eat Your Children was the German Shepard. Same stories, different breed. Everybody had """"statistics"""" and """"he turned on me for no reason!"""" stories. Then, for a while, it was the Rottweiler. And for a while, the Doberman had his turn. Notice, however, it's never the big, fluffy, pretty dogs with the big brown eyes (despite the fact that Chows tend to be exceedingly temperamental and I'd never own one again myself... I'll take a pit over a Chow any day). 

 * Hysteria sells papers. 

 """"There may be a killer in your home right now!"""" 

 """"Details at 11."""" 

 Come on people, the boogeyman gets ratings and sells papers. Do you really expect to see (many) articles or TV news stories of... 

 """"You probably shouldn't own a dog because you don't care enough to educate yourself on how to properly socialize and train a dog nor do you have the sense to realize dogs aren't stuffed animals."""" 

 Yeah our media could bother to do some real education but it's more profitable to scare people into hiking their skirts and running around shrieking in terror (for details, see the current US administration). 

 * Dogs don't get to testify in court. 

 As in do you really believe a dog owner is going to tell the police, """"well, I was giving the dog his daily beating when, for no reason at all, he turned on me.""""? We have no way to verify the stories. I take all """"the dog turned on me for no reason"""" stories with a grain of salt. At least until we have some way of getting the dog's side of the story.  

 * Temperament testing 

 As in here. The ATTS gives the American Pit Bull Terrier a rating of 84.1%. The Golden Retriever obtains 83.8%. So where are all the stories of Golden Retrievers unexpectedly """"turning on"""" their owners? Or assaulting people left and right? Why aren't they being banned?  

 Because they're pretty? 

 The Cocker Spaniel obtains 81.7% but they're pretty too so they must not attack people. The Collie, 79.2%. In short, Lassie is more likely to attack you than a Pit.  

 * Sometimes the bias really is on the other side 

 I see a lot of hand waving here about the bias of the article but nobody stops to consider that """"fair and balanced"""" can be taken to such an extreme that it entails destroying the truth. Sometimes, people really are full of horse droppings and to try to """"balance"""" reality is to do harm. And """"balance"""" with what? Urban legend? Yellow journalism? Self-reported """"statistics"""" that nobody bothers to verify?  

 * Your neighbor is a bigger risk to you than his dog 

 Yes, I own pits. Both rescue dogs. One was abused by his first owner. And, frankly, I like my dogs better than I like most of you. My dogs don't get addicted to crack and try to break into someone's house unlike some neighbors I've had. 

 Dogs aren't that complicated nor that hard to socialize and train if you bother to realize that they are actual living beings and not something to compliment the drapes. My Pits are loyal, affectionate, well behaved dogs. Even the one that had to be rescued from an abusive owner. That one took actual effort (heaven forbid... work!) to socialize after being traumatized by his first owner. Today, he's the most affectionate, playful, well behaved dogs I've ever owned. 

 We don't have a """"breed specific"""" problem, we have a human problem. As in stupid, small minded, ignorant people who want a dog as a toy or decoration. Such as my alcoholic, irresponsible, mooching off his mother, former neighbor that wanted a """"tough dog"""" when he shouldn't have been allowed anywhere near a dog. Worse still, he has a kid. That'll turn out well. 

 He was a classic example of the kind of person that was going to show up in the news one day saying, """"The dog turned on me for no reason."""" When the truth was, the dog would"

 Generally I don't have any problems with the L2 headings (ie H3) if the following criteria are fulfilled. [However in the case of countries and cities, absence of L2 headings do make the article look neat.] 
 * Don't use a single L2 under L1. (in the sandbox case: 2 & 2.1). A minimum of two subheadings are required to justify its use. 
 * If you have to use a subheading, it should have sufficient content. The =infrastructure= & =utilities= don't have too much. (Yeah I know Ann Abor does have a small heading, but that was Taxman's doing, & I've messaged Pentawing about it.)

 :: I agree that the Eiffel discussion degenerated, but the initial conflict (non-content based conflict) occurred the editors were more interested in the rules  """"no code snippets may be blue"""" and """"all code snippets for all programming languages must be in an identical format"""" than in producing good Wikipedia content.   

 :::Please, anon, well first get an account.  For someone taking such a tone of superiority, hiding behind and IP address is quite unseemly.

Rather there was a discussion of """"What is the best style convention to follow, given the minor difference between WP style guides and those of Eiffel Software?"""" Every editor, except Bertrand Meyer, discussed this in an open minded and collaborative way.  Meyer basically wrote: """"Fuck off, none of your opinions matter.""""  This had nothing to do with obeying or disobeying rules... it was an open, polite, and joint discussion of the how best to improve the article.  Meyer could not stomach the last of those adjectives, especially (though he did not appear all that fond of the first two either). Ã

 == Celebrities == 

 I find this confusing part under the current trends section:  

 """"Female international celebrities known for their waist-length or longer hair include Amal Clooney, Amanda Seyfried, Angelina Jolie, BeyoncÃ©, Blake Lively, Carrie Underwood, Demi Moore, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kate Hudson, Lea Michele, Olivia Palermo, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Shakira. <NB! Please limit the list to famous women who have had very long hair (at least waist-length), but not only from the US.>"""" 

 * I looked at the various articles referenced. The Amal Clooney, Kate Hudson, Angelina Jolie, Blake Lively, Lea Michele, Gwenyth Paltrow, Olivia Palermo, and Amanda Seyfried articles don't support the claim, whether through the photos included or in the text. Neither is there a citation given here. The BeyoncÃ©, Demi Moore, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Shakira articles includes photos that might be of hair that long if it's pulled out straight or if there was a better photograph, but it's unclear as things stand. The text doesn't support the claim, either. The only article that includes hair at all is Parker's where it mentions her contract with the Nutrisse company. A performer who truly had exceedingly long hair, well longer than waist length, is Crystal Gayle. (I don't know if she still does, though.) 

 * This is the first article I've seen where a note to the authors is included right in the text instead of on the Talk Page: """"<NB! Please limit the list to famous women who have had very long hair (at least waist-length), but not only from the US.>"""" I don't think it's appropriate. 

 * One of my WP peeves is when lists are included in an article, but without an obvious organizing factor. These women aren't arranged alphabetically or by age. They seem to have been included randomly, unless I'm missing something. 

 * Are men not celebrities, too? Are there no famous long hared men? And the definition of celebrity - does it only include actors and pop performers? What about people in other spheres who happen to have long hair? And why such a long list, anyway? If you think it's necessary, how about two or three examples and call it a night?

 ==More original research== 
 The talk page was actually more enlightening than the article, although that may be for lack of citations. To be honest, I cannot think of a Wikipedia-acceptable way to bring across into the article the points made in the talk page. Perhaps appropriate studies could be found in sports sociology or sports psychology journals? or maybe even anthropology journals? 

 On an objective level, the World Cup recently demonstrated to all of us some reasons why high scores over other teams might be necessary to advancement. For example, had Portugal-Brazil not ended in a tie in the Group of Death, the number of points scored over Korea DPR would have become highly relevant. This reason is loosely covered in the article (list), but I would suggest it is actually one of the least relevant points overall in the psychology of the thing. 

 What became strongly apparent in these discussion threads, in trying to explain cultural differences, was that in the United States and to a lesser extent Canada (especially in American football), it is considered dishonourable for a hugely dominant team to keep pushing hard, while in Britain/Europe/Australia (not enough opinions from elsewhere), it is considered dishonourable for *every* team not to push as hard as possible. 

 I notice that the question becomes most relevant in """"national"""" sports - American football and basketball for the United States, Association football and cricket for Great Britain, hockey and curling for Canada. I bring in curling, because this has a built-in international mercy rule allowing concession if any team falls more than eight points behind, the absolute maximum that can be scored in a single end (and almost always never is). In both hockey and curling you are required to go all out, always, but only curling gives an 'out'. (Canadians, too, tend to become upset with teams that declare future certainties  although much more so with non-Canadian teams. In the United States, not so much  in many cases it is seen as simply a statement of fact, but it must be achieved """"honourably"""".) American baseball, I would suggest, has different unspoken rules because, unlike American football, American baseball is financially designed to create long-lasting powerhouse dynasties. 

 The psychology of the thing does seem to be rooted in cheering for the underdog vs the assumption that if you lose, you deserve to lose and you need to get better (or get moved to a different conference). Much of the commentary re the British FIFA team was that if they did not advance, they had better not come home. In contrast, much of the commentary re the American FIFA team noted that United States teams tended to do best where they were rated the underdogs, but fell short against much less powerful teams. 

 Just as interesting to me is whose responsibility it is to keep the game """"fair"""" and/or """"fun"""", whatever the definition. In American football fixed divisions, United States commentators seem to place all the responsibility on the coach. European commentators, on the other hand, seem to place more responsibility for even matches on the association, per the Zimbabwe example above. (If they keep losing badly, the association will place them into a more appropriate level.) This frees the coach from all other responsibilities except to win. 

 All this comes from the discussion on this page only, in the context of various sports wins. Yet it cannot move onto the main article page, not in its current form. How does one cite tacit cultural assumptions and unspoken custom? - Tenebris"""

 == Not justified editings! == 

 So as earlier I said that I am neutral editor then I want ask why the cities Al Hirak and Al Zabadani which earlier was marked as contested but today have been marked under control of army. If there is no data from reliable sources that those cities under control of army they should again be marked as disputed.    
 : I have changed both cities to contested. No source for the changes were provided.   
 Al Zabadani is the biggest rebel stronghold in Al Qalamun. There are dozens of pictures posted only this year from opposition activists from inside the city. Rebels are clashing west of the city with SAA forces where SOHR reported that they managed to destroy 1 tank and kill dozens of Government foces. The city is controled by rebels and SOHR and other channels are reporting heavy airstrikes and barel bombardment on the city every few days.    
 :""""they managed to destroy 1 tank and kill dozens of Government forces"""" Right, sure they did, but the SAA just uses its 3D printer to make more fighters. Zabadani is not fully rebel controlled, there is a strong SAA presence inside the city, that is how the rebels keep attacking checkpoints in the city, so it should go back to contested.    
 :: Agreed SOHR did mention before attacks on CP's inside the city. Zabadani back to contested since Bloudan is so close and somewhat part of it and is entirely gov-held.    
 I did Google News checks on both of these locations. Where is this information coming from that there is ongoing fighting at either of these locations? Isn't SOHR just a single guy in the UK?    
 : Do you have a specific article/statement saying that the areas are government held? If not, then we cannot change it. As for SOHR, you are completely right, it is one guy in the UK claiming to receive phone calls from people in Syria. He is, however, considered a reliable source with corroboration, and there are other sources confirming fighting in Zabadani such as Al-Masdar news.    
 ::OK, where can I find the links to Al-Masdar news? I went to the relevant Wikipedia articles and looked at the entries in the big table, but found nothing like this.    
 ::: Sure, here is the link describing fighting in Zabadani as of January 4 of this year: http://www.almasdarnews.com/article/rif-dimashq-al-nusra-front-forced-withdraw-felita/    
 ::::Thanks, this helps me understand where the info is coming from    

 ::A critical reading of that lamasdarnews article  
 ::1) It generally just echos regime news reports, as it does in this case, so it must be considered pro-regime. 
 ::2) Al-Zabadani town is the main population centre of al-Zabadani district.  Bloudan is a small suburb of the town in the same district, at a somewhat higher altitude in the mountains.  The news report referred to a regime presence in the district, which we already acknowledge in calling Bloudan regime controlled. 
 ::3) Al-Zabadani town was under truce several times in the past, truces broken by regime bombardment.  As far as I know, the regime has not been able to make significant (if any) inroads into the town, which is in a high mountain valley.  The regime gained control of the much smaller Bloudan when the rebels there surrendered.  (If I remember correctly, it was reported because of a food and ammunition shortage.)  The regime must be supplying Bloudan by helicopter, since the only land route out is by al-Zabadani town. 
 ::4) Around al-Zabadani town there are regime checkpoints, which would be in the al-Zabadani district. 
 ::5) This almasdarnews report is from 2 weeks ago.  There have been regime bombardments on al-Zabadani reported most weeks in the last few years, even when it was under formal truce. 
 ::6) So I would say that al-Zabadani is most probably still besieged as it was when the last truce was broken, and not contested.  It is highly unlikely regime controlled.

Since access to affordable health care and educational attainment levels are pretty well correlated with poverty and income is clearly a sign of economic poverty, I thought they would be useful for inclusion in this article. I think more information about the distribution of poverty. particularly within the individual states is important. I there is another good article on that as well. As for the discussion on poverty in America, there seems to be confusion over relative and absolute poverty. Perhaps this article can address that.

 I would argue that as the article focuses on the use of gay as it refers to sexuality, the first sentence should reflect that by saying that in addition to gay referring to homosexuals, it also can be used to mean joyous and glad. Such a revision would also emphasize the predominate use of gay as a term for sexuality and its secondary use as a synonym for happy. 

 :""""Gay"""" still means joyous and glad, it's just that the other meaning is more common.   

 ::""""This word may safely be used only to mean homosexual."""" - The Globe and Mail Style Book 

 :::Who cares what the """"Globe and Mail Style Book"""" thinks?  The other meaning is still valid.  Just because you probably wouldn't use it in every day speech to mean """"joyous"""" or """"glad,"""" doesn't mean that these are invalid meanings.   22:30 21 Jul 2003 (UTC) 

 ::::Who care what all the dictionary definitions of a term are? This is an encyclopedia and as such we write about encyclopedic topics - the alternate dictionary definition of the word """"gay"""" doesn't fit the bill (although mentioning it somewhere in the historical development section of this article should be fine). The encyclopedic topic here is the contemporary usage of the term - its older meaning is just a part of that history. The secondary usage should not get first mention.  

 :::::But we clearly use and understand """"gay"""" to mean joyous and glad in the present day.  Everyone is familiar with the refrain """"don we now our gay apparel"""" and does not think that it means we are going to dress up as homosexuals; everyone understands the meaning of the phrase """"the gay Nineties""""; and particularly there are still """"gay blades.""""   13:03 22 Jul 2003 (UTC) 

 :::::: """"Gay Paris"""" with a french accent does not usually mean """"homosexual paris""""   

 :I agree with this. This aspect is confusing as a person looking for 'homosexual' would be redirected by the comment at the top, while missing significant content regarding the use of gay to mean homosexual lower down the page.. Perhaps a 'See also' would be more appropriate?   

 :Is there evidence that the """"gay"""" had a connotation of """"promiscuity"""" as the meaning transitioned from """"happy"""" to """"same-sex love""""? I heard it as an explanation for how gay suddenly acquired its current definition, but I haven't yet searched for the source of that.   

 * This is such a tiresome debate.  The word's usage has changed from """"jolly"""" to """"homosexual"""".  That's the sort of thing that happens to words in a living language. Dictionaries reflect that chance in usage through a changed definition.  Just as the term """"Christian"""" began as an insult and eventually got subverted into an identity term, this word has changed its meaning.  The term """"homosexual"""", it should be noted, has pathologically origins and is offensive to some gay and lesbian people. Some are now proposing the word """"queer"""" as a collective term (e.g., Queer Culture), but this has yet to find a home in the heart of every gay person.   

 :: What debate? I don't think there's any debate. I found the explanation in a history of the word offered by a womens' right and gender equity group. I didn't find the source so that I could investigate, and put it here to see if someone actually know where it comes from. Moreover, dictionaries may reflect changes in word, but they also should find how the word changes. It's partly the reason that Oxford Dictionary became popular, because it told how a word changed in spelling, pronunciation, and meaning. An encyclopaedium, while not a dictionary entry, should offer a sourced and more detailed explanation of how the word acquired its meaning because people would like to know, and such a long history can't be given in the dictionary. 

 :: There's nothing wrong with finding out that 'gay' might have first changed meaning into a euphemism for 'promiscuous', because gay might have reflected a wider usage for a large group of people performing on """"Broadway"""" (perhaps later referring to prostitution, """"gay old time"""" perhaps) before the meaning narrowed even more to focusing on the group of men with same-sex desire. That's the way word history can change, along with whether words become more negative or positive. 

 :: This would be very interesting to know, because then we can explain the split personality of 'gay' between being happy and being queer. It might have had an intermediate meaning for promiscuous before gay men used it as a code word to describe themselves. It might not be"

 ==Incorrect Scriptural Citation== 

 The main article references Joshua 18 which far predates post-Solomonic Israel.  The first citation for Jerusalem being the capital of Southern Kingdom is most likely in 1 Kings 12 instead.  Additionally, 2 Samuel 5:6-9 describes David conquering Jerusalem and making it his capital (Hebron served as his capital during the years he reigned over Judah alone). 

 Joshua 18:28 (NIV) reads """"Zelah, Haeleph, the Jebusite city (that is, Jerusalem), Gibeah and Kiriathâfourteen towns and their villages.  This was the inheritance of Benjamin for its clans.""""  While this obviously mentions Jerusalem, it does not lay it out as the capital of the Kingdom of Judah.    

 The division of the Unified Kingdom occurs in 1 Kings 12, with Rehoboam driving off the Northern Kingdom (Israel) with his harsh demands.

 Hi Robert 

 The problem I have is that there isn't by definition going to be a published source for this - the tape can be found in the BBC's own VT catlog (which used to be known as VTOL but now goes by a different acronym.) The problem is that this is closed system only accessible to BBC staff. So I suppose that if you really wanted to push the point my """"source"""" is a print out from VTOL which I still have in my files somewhere. The thing is without someone comming round to my house and looking at it or going to the BBC library and doing their own print out that isn't really a """"publication"""". 

 The fact that I worked at the BBC is easily verified however... because you only have to go to the www.vtoldboys.com - and look up my name in the """"credits"""" section where you will find it recorded that I was there from 1989 to 1997 and that I now work at TSWFTA in plymouth. (www.tswfta.co.uk) when you can see a picture of me working a Telecine machine. 

 Notwithstanding the lack of previous publication I feel that the information IS important as for many years the accepted wisdom has been that no copy survives of this recording. Since 1994 (when I found the film) I have known this to be incorrect (as do various other Ex and current BBC employees) but until now have lacked the means to communicate it. 

 I don't know where that leaves us... I am very new to this wikipedia world... and I have no wish to upset anyone... but for all the reasons stated i do feel that this information is important and shouldn't be arbitarily deleted simply because it is a previously unpublished fact. If we adopt that approach then surely no one will ever be able to add anything new?

 I entered into the article a point about the murder of Malcolm X, which I feel makes this organization most notable.   
 ::: Um, seriously speaking... I don't think it is proven fact that they did this.  I don't believe we can ever confirm who did it, or if they did it on the say so of the NOI or any other organization.  Malcolm X himself suspected more than just the NOI, judging by the last passages related by him in his Autobiography.  You can't say the NOI assasinated him unless you know it for fact.  It is possible, but it is irresponsible to suggest that it is fact until and unless some day it is proven as such.  Ismail

However, that is not the best way for us all to end up with articles which meet Wikipedia standards. I respectfully suggest that, if you want to add factual content to the article, fine. If you want to dispute what someone else had written, this is a good place to bring your case and cite your sources. If what you are writing is controversial, it won't hurt to say so. We want the article as whole to present a neutral point fo view, so POV positions while be so labeled and there will be every attempt at balance of facts to reach a NPOV in the presentation.

 As much as the NOI screams about racial oppression and black preservation, I find it funny that they basically spit on the gods of their """"native"""" Africa in favor of a Middle Eastern god. They want to hate one non-black race so they pretend to be another non-black race. 

 [Dumbass!  There are many practitioners of Islam

 Oh, maybe there is some truth to the NOI's claims that New Orleans was rigged. Maybe they rigged it themselves, because all the Voodoo practitioners who follow African gods are a threat to them. 

  
 This sentence makes no sense:   

 :It was based on the doctrine that out of all the nations of the earth, Black people, the only nation without any knowledge of their past history, no control of their present lives, and had no guidance for their future.  
 Yeah, but in general muslims don't really believe that whites (or any other race) were created by a mad scientist. islam is a religions of peace, where those who follow Islam, don't give races any importance.

No one seems to have a detailed knowledge of AS, so you all stumble about in the dark, shouting out to each other to try to see where you are in the darkness.  The intro to AS should hit you in the head.  Yes, AS bifurcates, but it is now primarily associated with Mises, subjectivism and praxeology.  Hayek's somewhat on the fringe, Rothbard's near the center (but studiously ignored by almost everyone because of his extreme, """"radical"""" views, which are really just the logical outgrowth of Mises).  Buchanan is a weak (lightweight?) Austrian, but could be mentioned if we want to name-drop Nobel winners to try to legitimize the school.  The lede should try to say to the ignorant newbie what the core ideas of AS are about.  It doesn't really do that anymore.  Because no one here knows what the Hell they are talking about. AS today is this: Kill the Fed, get the government out of regulating the economy, and allow a free market in money with each market participant being given the right to choose the means of exchange.  Austrians believe gold and silver will eventually be chosen, but we are open to the market deciding.  Simple.  Referenced.  Clear.  But I'm barred for saying it.

Other DAB pages don't have citation right on the page , and there seems little reason to have it in the article. Perhaps Viriditas read the request a bit too fast, and thought we wanted him to cite the actual page references (lol). He was asked to present the acronyms with citations in the Discussion page.

 NOw, either you make a new entry """"onus probandi (fallacy)"""" possibly redirecting to the english equivalent """"(shifting the) burden of proof"""" or you add a section to previous article adding """"burden of proof"""" fallacy.

So,let's recap: you must copy definition/explanation from """"list of fallacies"""" to [philosofical:delete] burden of proof or make a new article """"burden of proof(fallacy)"""" copy there the explanation and make a new redirect from """"onus probandi"""", later on I can improve the article.

 Keep your shirt on, wikipelli,1) I am a not a native speaker, mother-tongue is Latin, """"you must...later I can"""" means """"only you can...after that I am able to"""", if you do not like it change it to """"you ought to....if you desire that I..."""" OK?

3d8ffbd6e87afd70,":::Calling my question trolling is completely misunderstanding the problem. I was describing the activities of a person that is very active with harming cdrtools. This is no fun but a very problematic person is supported by the WP rules with his attacks and I am looking for a solution. The persom I am talking about writes text with his WP account and text with IP numbers and the cases where he uses IP numbers look very intentional. I created a log of 47 such IP based edits between December 2010 and now that verifies this behavior. The person also attacks cdrtools on his personal website and he tries (via anonymizing remailers) to blackmail Linux distributors that asked their lawyers and thus distribute the original cdrtools instead of the buggy and unmaintained fork from Debian.  

 :::Regarding the licensing section: In May 2004, a social attack against cdrtools was started by some people from Debian. These people later came up with the false claim that there was a legal problem in cdrtools in order to distract from their social attacks. They did never send any legally valid verification for their claims and many lawyers confirmed that there is no legal problem. The cdrtools article however quotes the claims from laymen with the intend to create the impression that there is a modicum of truth in these claims. This cannot be seen as a neutral report on this Debian initiated incidence but rather as an attempt to harm cdrtools. 
 :::Another problem in the licensing section is the fact that it attacks cdrtools by describing activitied in an intentionally reversed timeline in order to confuse cause and reaction. It would be easy to verify the real timeline as this is something that cannot be faked in the internet. 

 :::Any attempt to make the cdrtools article neutral failed so far. I understand an encyclopedia in a way that it may have to report about attacks but without becoming parts of the attackers. In our case, this would require to clearly mention that there is no verification for a legal problem."

 === Introduction === 

 """"Hi, my name's Linuxbeak, but you can call me Alex, seeing as that's basically my name.  Well... what can I say?  I first joined wikipedia back in March this year.  Me and my """"geek boy"""" persona soon got me noticed by the other male members, where I fit right in and was instantly accepted as """"just one of the gang"""". That was when I met Taxman.  Meeting a man who was so open about his sexuality really changed how I express myself.  It allowed me to explore a whole new side of my persona.  Of course, the webcam performances helped a great deal.  Watching a man you've never met stroke his sweaty testicles through the anonymity of a computer screen had a strange appeal to me.  I'd definitely recommend it.  And the live demonstrations really came in handy.  I can't say I like being called Linuxcunt, but the name's sort of stuck. 

 If I were to really pin down where my homosexuality stems from, I'd have to point to my small penis. It's a pecker.  I spent a lot of time during my childhood comparing it to pictures in magazines.  I guess a subscription to Gay Weekly didn't help either.  Mum, if you're reading this, I guess you now know: your only son's a fudgepacker.  No shit (sic)."""""""

Churchill in particular had always been adamant that 'Ulster' would not be coerced into a union with the south against its wishes.

The Buffy comics/novels are meant to be set in the same universe as the show, it's just snobby fans don't count them because they're not by Joss Whedon (who also dismisses them).

Thats why I'm interested in some discussion. I don't know if you had reverted my changes because they broke some Wikipedia standard or rule in which case ignore this message. My reasoning behind the change was because there is growing mention of common rail diesel in the media outlets. The media refers to it as CRD and says things like wave of the future... 55mpg... not a hybrid... and so on and so forth. When I searched for CRD I got the disambiguation page and in it was a brief definition of common rail diesel but no link to the common rail article. I created a link to the article and went back and studied the other items on the disambiguation. I found that none of the others have good length articles nor have more popularity. So I redirected the page to common rail and setup a link on top of common rail to the disambiguation. As common rail grows in popularity and becomes noticeable on the streets of 2008 I hope that you reconsider your decision. Thank you."

 Am Basically an animation student, currently doing my B.sc in Animation and Film Making, and i also do freelance designing works too, like  
 Broucher design, logo designs, flyers, lot more designing stuffs, learnt a lot from my daily mistakes improved it now giving the best quality to the customers. I always have interests in all kind of arts. When I was a kid I had my own computer. I had the opportunity to work on it. I think I was 8-9 years old. But of course I used the computer for games painting and stuffs like that i was inspired a lot by games i used to sketch those stuffs i used to love drawing but a long gap i lost the touch and got used to computer and the wonderful software which is playing a huge success in my life and am loving it.I have been learning Photoshop on my own. In the beginning I made all my projects for me without aim. At that time I didn't have much Photoshop tutorials and I had to experiment with this program. Little by little it became my hobby. I could remember that I had interest in matte painting but not for a long time. Graphic Design will be my love forever.I think that everyone can find the inspiration that it needs in everything around us. I find inspiration in music, people, nature, movies and other artist too. I usually spend more time in watching something then working. The ideas often come in that way. But maybe the biggest inspiration we can find in our imagination.When I start a new project the main idea that I have at the beginning of the work often change to another. In the process of work a new idea and inspiration appear so I can change the whole conception. I often start something then anotherâ¦ I forgot the first that I start and after a couple of months for example I come back to this unfinished work again.I always make experiment on new techniques. I always try to mention innovations with every new project. I mix different styles and techniques trying to find something new.Iâd love to do the posters and covers for a major film. I think a lot of modern film posters are boring and are just a photoshopped up image of the main character. It would be awesome to do something for a film that has a bit of character to it such as a Tarantino film. At last i have some basic knowledge of editing stuffs too i get movie stuffs too but held up with loads of designing stuffs i have given a pause for them as of now i will shortly work on those too."

 To reply on what Frank Close actually says: 

 ;Extracts from Chapter 9, The Infinity Puzzle, 2013. Relevant snips underlined, rest is to add context 
 * Although several people discovered the mechanism whereby vector gauge bosons can acquire mass, Brout and Englert being the first to publish a relativistic demonstration, only Higgs drew attention to the consequential existence of a massive scalar particle, which now bears his name. 

 * By the late summer of 1964 they [Guralnik and Hagen] had """"pretty much everything but still had concerns over some fine details."""" His former mentor Walter Gilbert was lecturing at a summer school at Lake Como, so Guralnik made a special trip to tell him what they had achieved.... At the very time when Guralnik was talking with Gilbert, Higgsâs paper was already in production. This would become apparent only later... 

 * Unaware of this even more precious jewel that lay just out of their reach, Guralnik and Hagen drafted a manuscript, and showed it to Kibble, asking for any additional input. Fate was about to deal them a cruel blow. During 1964 Britain had had a series of postal strikes, which had delayed the mail. Their memory of events, as described in several accounts,[29] is that as they were about to send the final version of their manuscript to PRL, Kibble came in and announced that in the backlog of mail were """"three papers, one by Robert Brout and FranÃ§ois Englert... and two by Peter Higgs."""" All three also seemed to have discovered how a gauge boson could become massive.  

 * Guralnik, Hagen, and Kibbleâs work was tightly argued and contained unique insights toward understanding the depth of these new ideas. However, the sad fact was that they had been scooped. They added references to those papers into the text but changed nothing, nor did they add anything as a result of what had happened. They sent the manuscript to Physical Review Letters, where it was received on October 12, 1964.... By that oversight, they had implicitly placed themselves as runners-up... 

 * Gerald Guralnik was one of those who approached the finishing line early but failed to publish fast enough. 

 * In another of the coincidences in this tale, the editor of PRL received Higgsâs manuscript on the very same day that Brout and Englertâs paper was published. When Higgsâs paper finally appeared in print, on October 19, Brout and Englert were surprised to see that it included a reference to their own: """"He couldnât have seen our paper, so how did he know of it?"""" Higgs explained: Nambu had been the referee of both papers and """"had drawn attention to the work of Brout and Englert. I added a remark about their work."""" Their researches were truly independent; in 1964 manuscripts were typed and then submitted by the regular mail. [...] There is no dispute that Brout and Englert were first to complete and first to publish. So why is it that Higgsâs name is associated with the massive boson and not those of Englert or Brout? The answer is that so far everyone has been addressing what happened to Goldstoneâs massless boson. However, there remains the issue of Goldstoneâs other bosonâthe massive one. This is what Higgs had uniquely included in his revised paper, the one that appeared in PRL. Two years later, he developed the ideas in a longer paper, setting in motion the events that would make his name. 

 * So it was that Brout, Englert, and Higgs had all published papers, while GHK were writing their own paper, ignorant of developments due to the British postal strike until the fateful moment when Kibble announced the news. 

 * Tom Kibble recalled: """"As a matter of fact [in 1964] the Higgs Boson was not seen by anyone as a particularly important feature. The interest [then] was in the way the gauge vector bosons acquired a mass, eating up the Goldstone [massless] Boson on the way. Now of course itâs important because... its observation would confirm the validity of the theory."""" ... Kibbleâs perception of the perceived unimportance historically is in accord with the memories of others, which were aired when the six shared the Sakurai Prize in 2010. For Englert and Brout, """"This was our first paper in field theory and we were somewhat isolated. We didnât know about Glashowâs work [on the SU2 Ã U1 model of the weak and electromagnetic forces] at all."""" 

 * During the International Conference on High Energy Physics at Berkeley in 1966, Ben Lee prominently referred to the âHiggs Bosonâ and the âHiggs Mechanism.â ... As the GHK team, including Hagen, had not completed their paper until after the appearance of Higgsâs original papers, and as Higgs had built on this further during 1966, with a study of how"

Fill out the form given, link to the arbitration action being broken (in this case, the indefinite ban for socking given at the bottom of WP:Requests for arbitration/Depleted uranium#Log of blocks and bans), present what evidence you can, explain that you have additional evidence that involves quoting that editor's real name (and whatever else it was you searched on) and that you want arbcom to say """"yes, go ahead"""" before posting it (it's used in the proceedings, so they'll probably tell you to go ahead but check anyways), and then link to the SPIs (and probably this thread as well for completeness), explaining that the SPI has been sitting idle for quite a while, presumably due to complexity and backlog. They'll want to see a rationale for bringing it to AE rather than SPI (or requesting help at WP:AN); the rationale is that a) it relates to an arbcom case, and b) you aren't sure what to do about real-name information and were told that they were the people to ask. Maybe also ask them if starting a LTA entry for this editor is a good idea (they've been socking for many years now; the indef ban was applied after two shorter bans for that). 

 The other option is to take a break from it for a while, and only start up again once they start socking again. When chasing long-term offenders, there's always the risk of getting too tied up in it. The end result of that tends to be either burnout or crossing the line into wiki-stalking or other harrassing behaviour (that's part of what Hillman got in hot water for back in the day). We've lost enough good editors as it is, so use your best judgment and don't be afraid to take time away to do things that are actually fun as well.

 == Phones == 

 I think we need a table of phones. I suggested this to  on  for the English language article, and he seems to be unconvinced, but it may be more appropriate here. The value of a phones table is to show all the possible sounds that actually occur in English. At the moment, the table only includes phonemes, and does not reflect the fact that most dialects of English have aspirated and preglottalized stops, a glottal stop, voiceless sonorants, that some dialects have an alveolar flap or trill, voiceless w, and so on. This is somewhat unhelpful to speakers of languages that have these sounds as separate phonemes, and recognize their occurrence in English. 

 Here's a phones table with notes. I'm not sure about the arrangement of the aspirated stops, and I didn't include preglottalized stops. Arrangement may need to be tweaked. Also, I'm not sure whether this table counts as OR, or is an appropriate synthesis of information provided by sources. â Â·  

 ===Table=== 
 This table shows the consonant sounds in English. Phonemes are unmarked, but allophones are enclosed in parentheses, and dialectal phones are marked with asterisks.

 * Fortis stops and affricates  are always voiceless. They are aspirated  when they occur alone at the beginning of stressed syllables, as in pin , but are unaspirated in other cases, as in spin . At the end of words, they are frequently preglottalized, as in nip . 
 * Lenis stops and affricates  are always unaspirated. They are partially voiced at the beginning and end of words, as in bin  and nib , and fully voiced between vowels, as in about . 
 * The dental fricatives  are lost in some dialects, and instead pronounced as labiodental fricatives , or dental or alveolar stops  (th-fronting or th-stopping). Both pronunciations occur in Southern England, Ireland, and in African American Vernacular English. 
 * The alveolar stops  are pronounced as an alveolar flap  between vowels in the United States, Canada, Australian, and New Zealand (intervocalic alveolar-flapping). 
 * The alveolar stop  is pronounced as a glottal stop  before nasals in most dialects, as in button , and after vowels in Southern England, as in butter  and what .

 == RE: Prince of Persia == 

 Excuse me, but I don't understand what you mean.  If you want to know where I got the information on the paragraph I added in the edit you supplied, the player learns it gradually throughout the game.  The game has """"open dialogue,"""" meaning the player can trigger dialogue between the two protagonists, the Prince and Elika, at any given moment in the game.  There are specified moments when an icon will appear at the bottom of the screen, indicating that Elika wants to talk to the Prince.  The dialogue provided at these given points are typically vital to understanding the story, and usually provides the player with a rich background story for either the Prince, Elika, or the antagonist whose domain the player is in at the time the icon appears.  I went through the game and triggered each of these dialogues with Elika at every given moment where it was indicated that I should, and the Prince revealed quite a bit of his background story.  The Concubine, one of four primary antagonists of the game, provides a lot of the Prince's background story as well.  She continually taunts him throughout the game, telling him that he """"doesn't really know who he is,"""" asking if he's a """"prince or a pauper,"""" and at one points she even asks him why he ran from his destiny as a prince. 

 There is also the Nintendo DS counterpart to the game, titled The Fallen King.  While The Fallen King doesn't provide many of the key aspects of the Prince's background story, it does delve deeper into who he is.  It gives the player a good sense of where the Prince's loyalties lie, and why he fights, when it seems like he doesn't care.  The Nintendo DS counterpart is extremely useful in understanding the Prince, if the player didn't during the console game. 

 I hope I've provided insight into your questions, and if you have any more questions, please feel free to ask them .    """

 == Gender Pronoun Issue == 

 This article, while informative, is a bit difficult to follow.  The reason is the switching of gender use from main biological designation to self-determined gender identity (though sadly, in this case, that identity was a little shaky.) 

 I'm not here to pass judgement on a person who was forced to live a lie, and was brutally murdered.  The facts of the story are harrowing and bleak. 

 However, this is an Encyclopedia of sorts, a damn good one in my opinion.  And I do question the pronoun usage - it makes the article confusing at first run.  I understand that there is a """"pronoun reclamation"""" movement going on in the LGBT community, and that it is being led by American youth and spreading to colleges nation-wide.  I went to Hampshire College - I understand these things. And I applaud young persons shifting social norms and working for justice. 

 But can new language usage be forced upon a readership?  I'm not certain it can, certainly not without some confusion.  What are the literary precedents for dealing with this new usage - is there a general consensus with regards to academic writing?  I'm curious. 

 I don't know what the solve is, and I'm conflicted about the entire idea of pronoun re-assignment.  I have very rigid ideas about grammar.   But my problem with the article is honestly simply one of parsing information in the quickest manner possible.  And I thought it pertinent to express my confusion in contrast to the Edit Request made by a certain other gentlemen."""

I think there is a large disconnect between the use of the word """"murder"""" as in """"has been legally convicted of murder"""" and what any sane person, looking at the available evidence from the media, would immediately describe as """"murder"""". Of course, the outcome of legal procedings is sometimes wrong. And many people, even after they have been fully identifed, commit murders and escape justice. This does not make them innocent of murder. It just means they have not been legally convicted. Wikipedia still has to be guided by due legal process, of course, even if it is flawed, and however long it takes to complete. But by the same token, where there is little or no doubt as to the identities of the killers, how can a article title which uses the simple phrase """"Murder of"""" be justified? The two killers here may never reach trial. But if they do survive their intervening custody, until they are convicted, we'd have to use the politically correct """"Suspected muder of"""" or """"Alledged murder of"""". In the real world, I'd argue there are few reliable sources saying """"These men murdered Lee Rigby"""" only because reporters don't want to state the obvious, not because they have ethical misgivings or fear legal censure.

But the Republicans are also correct that it's only the latest of many climate changes throughout the earth's history. The two-party system sets these up as opposites to prevent the public from making the obvious conclusion from both of them: We are not, as it's fashionable to say, hurting the earth. We are hurting the artificial structures our ancestors have imposed upon the earth throughout the past 10000 years or so. If humanity goes extinct, the earth will return to the natural state of chaos it was in before humanity arose. If we were to take literally the environmentalists' exhortation to respect nature, we would be encouraged to continue changing the climate until we're all dead; because if nature is defined as something to which emotions can be shown, then our mere existence is disrespectful. On the contrary, the cause of actually protecting the environment  rather than just waxing poetic about it  has always been our duty to each other as fellow humans. 

 The religious conception of humanity as a category, disguised in secular garb, allows the false inference that if the economy puts some people inside a wall, other people must be outside. However, humanity is not a category; it is merely one of many instances of the category of animal species. So it is indeed possible for all people to be inside the wall. The establishment has brainwashed us into thinking that treating animals as the other leads to cruelty against them. On the contrary, cruelty against people called the other has always been based on the realization that they are in fact people and only the charade of cruelty can pretend otherwise. Furthermore, it is only by fabricating a connection with animals that a ritual of cruelty can be established to displace the natural tendency to treat them humanely.

Could you explain to me what I did specifically to upset you so I don't make the same mistake in the future? I found some additional sources for this article and I was simply trying to reorganize it to make it easier to read.  

 Best, 

    

 :I wasn't upset. There was no reason to suppose your revert (edit-war instead of WP:BRD) was done by accident, so your edit sum in that context seemed snarky. (Am curious to understand how TW works re edit sums [I don't use that s/w myself]: how is the edit sum generated, by drop box selection? a programmed default? And does it display each edit for approval such as clicking 'send' or something? Thx for explain.) At any rate, article leads are suscribed to be up to four paras for mature articles, so I don't understand the compulsion to reduce the Kasparov lead to one sentence. Also, a section title  """"Background"""" is implicit re lead material, so relocating material to section of that name is redundant and therefore disimprovement. Ok,

Jackass Number Two, in contrast to all other Jackass films, opened with """"I'm Johny Knoxville, and I'm gonna film wee man nude, do a shit on camera, fly a kite using anal beads shoved up my ass, ram a dildo up my ass on high speed using a 50kg weight"""" I would not EVER consider this a proper Jackass movie: blood and stupidity has been replaced with """"putting a crocheted mouse on my penis and filming it"""" (This really happened!!!) 

 PS: I only watched about 10 minutes worth of REAL material on this film. After the opening line had become gay, I'd skipped to the next chapter; later came to the realization that Live Male-Male Dildoing was regularly featured i was disgusted!

cd2e0fb8a6714757,":::I think you're misunderstanding what diffusing means. American politicians is not non-diffusing, African-American politicians is. A non-diffusing cat is one which doesn't remove contents from the parent. A cat can be non-diffusing on one parent and diffusing on another. Secondly, absolutely ergs trees should be 'less navigable' - otherwise you'd have to reproduce the whole generic tree in gender and ethnicity and religion as well, which would cause complications even worse than we have now. There is a limit, we simply disagree on where that line is. Now, of course an EGRS cat can be diffused (ex:by nationality, by job) but the cat itself - and importantly, all of the contents, no matter how deeply nested, - must always be non-diffusing on any neutral parent. Do you understand the difference? One is a description looking up the tree, the other is going down the tree - so obviously Women can be diffused, but it _must_ be non-diffusing on People. Where it gets confusing is where people want to create a subcategory that is diffusing in one tree and non-diffusing in another - like women in forestry is diffusing of women by occupation, but it's non-diffusing of people in forestry - and that's where last rung rule and other ergs guidelines come into play. (Fwiw, i read your cites on forestry and am simply not convinced they cover the broad sweep of that category)  these mezzanine cats also pose a big risk because by simply adding them to a new neutral parent you can immediately ghettoize all of their contents without even realizing it.  Finally as to your points on peas and corn etc, you seem to think that if we group people by X, we can group women by X. This is really deeply wrong, and I really wish you'd understand why. A gendered or ethnic category -even a container - has a much higher bar, if we could do gender + arbitrary container category this would add thousands of cats to the tree. We should not, we should focus such containers to cases where we can establish that the container is itself an object of study, or utility containers like X by nationality. Otherwise we are implicitly making a claim of importance not backed up by sources. I don't target gender cats, I target all bad cats, it just so happens I have a special eye for useless gender cats having done lots of deghettoization, it frustrates me to see these lying about and I think it's bad for the wiki, and my record is pretty good, the cfd crowd seems to agree with the bulk of my proposals. I also create gendered cats sometimes, or help rearrange trees, I recently did some work unwinding princes and princesses for example, so I'm not against them, I'm just picky, unlike our friend Ottawa who has created many dozens, stuffed one person inside and then gone away. I think care should be taken before creating a gendered cat and the ghettoization potential negative is much worse than any marginal navigational benefit in many cases."

 No problem. I still consider your contributions valuable. The 500 references were acquuired rather quickly, and their quality was not as good as they could be. The Compton scattering references look the poorest quality, but the rest seem pretty good; 30 out of 31 references to Brillouin scattering and redshift look good, and I suspect that the other scattering redshifts are good too. 

 My concern with the article is that it will turn into a scientific article on Doppler-like redshifts, whereas it should be a more general article aimed at 12-year-old, explaining why Doppler redshifts are used in astronomy, and why other kinds of redshifts have been considered and possibly rejected. A more scientific article in its own right is still relevant, but called """"Doppler-like redshifts"""" (or similar). 

 I don't know why theoretical redshifts should be excluded. Tired light and scattering theories and redshift were also important in the history of redshift, and neutrino redshifts could be a vital distinguising factor between different kinds of redshift. Theory is a vital pillar of the scientific method, and an explanation of why Cosmological redshift is better than, for example, tired light and Compton scattering, demonstrates the scientific method better than pretending that tired light is insignificant and should be excluded.

Then on my morning commute I heard a request on one of the podcasts I listen to. Again, the first time I had heard them to my knowledge and I listen to a few Christian rock podcasts. 

 With the revert of my revert a comment was added 600K sales Grammy nomination US chart s #15 Topped Christian charts = popular enough. First, they're still not as popular as the other artists listed there: Skillet, Thousand Foot Krutch, Decyfer Down, Underoath, Kutless, and Relient K. The highest their music charted was #15. That does not mean that they charted #15 in the year (in one chart and #1 in two others). I could be misreading the information though. They did have two number one singles which is impressive, but not an unheard-of feat. And they have sold a total of 600Â 000 between the two albums. The final point is that the paragraph starts: """"By the late 1990s and early 2000s"""". They are a band from the late 2000s.

 :*...So is the Turkish Consul General [alive and well], now complaining to the university administration that the Center of Comparative Genocide Studies, which I direct, has (unfairly?, unwisely?) allowed the Greek community to fund a research unit devoted to the genocide of the Pontian Greeks, by the Turks, after World War I. The Center, founded by me at the end of 1993, has its somewhat clumsy title because the senior professor above, the one who wanted """"balance"""", was a little anxious at the University Council meeting, which has the power to establish Centers, that plain """"Genocide Studies"""" would be a little unbalanced -""""You know, a little too, ah, you know..."""" We know. There is of course, a very strong case for the visibility of """"comparative"""": it allows us to develop a model of gradiations of genocide, to avoid the obvious trap of flattening all genocides, of allowing scholars to get away with blatant misuse of the term when they seek to highlight a wrong by reaching for the ultimate cannon in the armory.''[7] (note: which HE directs has allowed, and also note how nice he puts it for all deniers)

 == Brilliance == 
 Did I miss something when the IQ tests were being passed out?     
 :No offence but your just one of the biggest jerks that I've ever met here. You have some sort of agenda against several people here and for what reason... well I have no clue, but for you to insult me for no reason is well....lets put it like this, not the best idea.   
 ::No offense? What the hell? Put your brain in  gear before your fingers move across the keyboard, Coldplay. You have  absolutely no idea what you're getting into.    

 This looks fun.  |   

 :: Run along and play elsewhere, Coldplay; you should know that if you attack me on MF's page, plenty of civility police are likely to block you, and few of us would cry over that.     
 ::Oh yes but you can just insult me all day if you'd like and no one would ever dare to mess with you. Am I correct?   
 :::I'm not talking about tangling with SandyGeorgia. Your comments about the issues with Mattisse are astonishingly ignorant and show you to be thoughtless and impetuous. STOP and research before you go off and make judgments about the people who have very patiently waded through this crap factory for years. Do this, please.    

 ::""""No offence""""? """"Biggest jerk""""? Amateur!    

 Everyone ... the deteriorating situation with Mattisse over the past few weeks has brought a lot of stress upon everyone, and nerves have grown quite raw all around. Now that there's a good understanding of what has been going on, can I suggest that people do their best to turn the page, or if that's not likely, that those of you who are quarrelling try to avoid one another for a few days? Regards,    
 :Day late and a dollar short, eh Brad? Thank God I saved you!    
 Oh yes. It's just a picknick when it comes to avoiding what people post on WR and here. """"Let's all just be friends"""". or """"Let's all try to get over it?"""" How can that be possible. We've got (IMHO) idiots like SandyGeorgia and Fred who love to get a crack out of attacking people like me and then we have people that are screwed like me who are trying to get out of this mess. It's not as easy as you'd think. And yes I have read over EVERYTHING. And after haveing a few converstions with Mattisse herslf, I think that she only socks because she tries to escape people like SG and whatnot. So sue me, It's my opinon. Take it or leave.   
 :Calling another editor an idiot is attacking.  Are you getting a crack out of it?   |   
 :Is this going to be like when Michael Myers  dies and the last person to see him kill someone somehow morphs into a  serial killer for the badly produced sequel? Can I expect you to shoot passive aggressive non-comments and vague  accusations, neglecting to follow them up with any substance, well, four  of you, in a slow but steady campaign of  morale assassination?

 ::::::Agreed.  I especially liked when you acknowleged that despite the treatment of familiaris and dingo in certain sections of this article (both as it stands and that in your sandbox which slated to replace the article), the scope of this article must be limited to """"naturally evolved Canis lupus"""" as you say.  That's perfect.  """"Naturally evolved Canis lupus"""" actually overlaps perfectly with the percieved contextual referent of the word English word """"wolf"""" as found in context, (not to mention the referents of any of the many other northern hemesphere languages that you have there on the replacement article).  The problem lies in the fact that, since dogs were shown to be domesticated wolves, Canis lupus no longer overlaps perfectly with """"wolf"""".  The solution that Wikipedia concensus has evolved is the independant Canis lupus hatnote that sends one to the article Subspecies of Canis lupus for the modern referet of the taxon in full.  This hatnote frees the referent of this article, including its historical range map to be that of the common term """"Wolf"""" (""""Vulk"""", etc).  I ask that you remember to keep this in mind when replacing the article and preserve (or even improve) the independant Canis lupus redirect when you make the change.   
 ::::::I volunteer to take responsibility not to make the changes to the map myself, but rather to see to it that the proper work order is filed at the proper place on Wikipedia to get the work done, if you would just describe again exactly exactly what changes you want to the historical range map.  
 ::::::I also volunteer to help you get the lupus/latras emergent hibrid species range map made by someone.  Describe it exactly once again just to be sure we understand and I'll find the graphic art work request place and get someone to do it for you.  There are, I'm sure, many Wikipedians who will jump at the chance to make such a map if you can describe it exactly, it's a matter of finding the right request place and writing the request well, that's all. In fact, there may be someone with the graphics skills to do that reading these words right now!?!  The only thing is, I think you'll agree, this should be different from the historical range map because as an emergent species known only coming into existance now, the Eastern """"Coyote"""" has no historical range. This other map should not worry about subspecies of lupus, don't you think, and just show the modern ranges of (1.) C. latrans x C. lupus, (2.) C. latrans, and (3.) C. lupus. That'd be fantastic!  Then people could look out there windows and know what to expect based on where in North America they are, finally, and we'll all be in your debt for that knowledge.   """

 == New archive == 
 This page has been quiet for a few weeks, so I created a new archive at Talk:Monty Hall problem/Archive 9 for the discussions from mid Oct 2008 through Feb 2009 (indicated as """"archived"""" above).  Several of the issues aren't exactly resolved (they will perhaps never be resolved to everyone's satisfaction), but the period of relative calm seemed like an opportune time to create a new archive.  I added a new section (post archiving) much like this one.   has reverted these changes, suggesting we talk about it first.  OK.  Since we're at a lull in the discussion here, and the talk page is huge, I suggest now is an appropriate time to archive.      

 : Agree with archiving now. The talk page is monster-sized, and nobody is going to read through it all anyway. â   

 :I don't agree there has been a 'lull'. It's just been re-directed to the arguments page. I assume most readers (not necessarily editors) do NOT read archives. If they're interested, maybe they get as far as a talk page. Anyway, I think that the existence and vehement nature of the MHP article disagreement would not be evident if the entire thing were archived. A reader might think that there was universal satisfaction with the construction of the article. That would be an inaccurate impression to give.    

 ::This thread will remain here, and it already says there are unresolved issues.  If you'd like to enumerate them here that will remain here as well.  Good enough?     

 :I didn't know there was an """"arguments"""" page, so I too thought it had settled down.  It would be very useful to have a concise list here of what the ongoing issues about the article are, phrased as neutrally as possible, with links to where some discussion about them may be found.

And finally in the last phase Spore allows the player to experiment with the ecosystem. These all were mentioned to be aspects of life simulation game. I am saying that it should be called god game/life simulation game as said in some of your newspaper articles. It seems that you are trying to be against many other wikipedias and also other people in this wikipedia.

 ::::::Depends on the circumstances.

 Perhaps this should be discussed at WP:ITN or a related page, where people more familiar with the ITN process could consider the objections.   

 What the heck is the Stanley Cup? I have never heard of it. However if you haven't heard of HP you've been in a cave for 10 years.  
 :If a kid (not living in a cave for 10 years) from Sierra Leone knows about HP, I'd be impressed. I actually didn't know the FA Cup existed until we had cable 5 years ago.     

 Honestly you guys should forget about it.  Does any one know the State Champion of the British World Cup Tennis Championship in 1996? (that is without looking it up)....no?  Am i right?  People come and go, so do most books.  The Harry Potter series will be collecting dust in peoples basements in little more than 5 years time. 
 Its fantasy, its fiction, and it will be forgotten before you know it.  Yeah it sells!  So what!  So do tickets for the 'Big Game'.   
 If something wants to be remembered, it usually needs more than just a title!

 Some of the things written seem to be completely wrong in how they are characterized.  So for example """"a pre-op trans woman possessing both breasts and male genitalia"""" does not make sense.  If they contain both a penis and breasts then they are not pre-op they are post-op.  Another example: """"It is a common misconception and stereotype that all transgender and transsexual women are heterosexual (attracted to males).""""  this again is totally reversed, if they are biologically male and are attracted to other males, they are homosexual not heterosexual, no matter what surgical alterations they have made to their body.

You might see on articles' talk pages something like """"Hi, I work for Sun and I'd like the following external link added: http://www.sun.com/example. Is that OK?""""

And yeah it is good experience in judging FACs and GANs etc. I actually have my eye on an article that I reckon I can get up to GA standard if I get off my lazy ass.

Oh and as for joining Wikipedia:WikiProject Nintendo/WikiForce SmashBros, I don't know about that. I don't really know enough about the series to join, and it seems in pretty good hands already, judging by the FTC. Still, I can keep an eye on them, and be involved in discussions about them, like the current ones. Incidentally, I'm curious about two unrelated questions: how many pages does a user typically have on their watchlist, and any ideas when abouts you first started improving the SSB articles (just coz I'm interested to know how an article like those have improved up to getting FA status)? Thanks if you can answer those questions, and keep up the hard work!   """

 Hi.  I've closed the sockpuppetry investigation that was opened against you on November 3.  The evidence presented to suggest that the account  was your sockpuppet was not sufficiently convincing (in my opinion) to justify taking action.

 I would strongly advise you not to create any more sockpuppet accounts, unless you can provide a very, very good explanation of what you are doing and why you need more than one account.  The only reason you were not given a block right now is that the above sockpuppets hadn't been used for several weeks, and any sanction against you at this time for these actions would be purely punitive (something which Wikipedia sanctions are not supposed to be).

 Why muslims have no choice but to hate infidels 

  
 My muslim brothers, if you wanna be a true muslim, you dont have much of a choice. 

 [Chapter 33 verse 36] 

 And it is not for a believer, man or woman, to have any choice in 
 their affairs, when God and His Apostle have decreed a matter: and 
 whoever disobeyeth God and His Apostle, erreth with palpable 
 error. 

 [33.36] And it behoves not a believing man and a believing woman that they should have any choice in their matter when Allah and His Apostle have decided a matter; and whoever disobeys Allah and His Apostle, he surely strays off a manifest straying. 

  
 No matter how nice those lovely infidels are, do not under any circumstances befriend them (unless you wanna go to hell). 

  
 [Chapter 3 verse 28] 
 Let not believers take infidels for their friends rather than 
 believers: whoso shall do this hath nothing to hope from God 
 unless, indeed, ye fear a fear from them: But God would have 
 you beware of Himself; for to God ye return. 

 [Chapter 4 verse 89] 
 They desire that ye should be infidels as they are infidels, and that 
 ye should be alike. Take therefore none of them for friends, till 
 they have fled their homes for the cause of God. If they turn back, 
 then seize them, and slay them wherever ye find them; but take 
 none of them as friends or helpers 

 [Chapter 60 verse 1] 
 O YE who believe! take not my foe and your foe for friends, 
 shewing them kindness, although they believe not that truth which 
 hath come to you: they drive forth the Apostles and yourselves 
 because ye believe in God your Lord! If ye go forth to fight on my 
 way, and from a desire to please me, and shew them kindness in 
 private, I well know what ye conceal, and what ye discover! 
 Who so doth this hath already gone astray from the even way. 

  
 And if you absolutely hate violence, do the violent act anyway because it is good for you even if you find it absolutely revolting. Remember, God knows what is good for you. 

  
 [Chapter 2 verse 216] 
 War is prescribed to you: but from this ye are averse. 
 Yet haply ye are averse from a thing, though it be good for you, 
 and haply ye love a thing though it be bad for you: And God 
 knoweth; but ye, ye know not. 

  
 It's okay to kill your fellow citizens, even your next door neighbours, if you are doing God's work. 

 [Chapter 9 verse 123] 
 Believers! wage war against such of the infidels as are your 
 neighbours, and let them find you rigorous: and know that God is 
 with those who fear him. 

 [9.123] O you who believe! fight those of the unbelievers who are near to you and let them find in you hardness; and know that Allah is with those who guard (against evil). 

 [Chapter 66 verse 9] 
 O Prophet! make war on the infidels and hypocrites, and deal 
 rigorously with them. Hell shall be their abode! and wretched the 
 passage to it! 

  
 AND FINALLY, dying for Allah is the greatest bliss 

  
 [Chapter 9 verse 111] 

 Verily, of the faithful hath God bought their persons and their 
 substance, on condition of Paradise for them in return: on the path 
 of God shall they fight, and slay, and be slain: a Promise for this is 
 pledged in the Law, and in the Evangel, and in the Koran and who 
 more faithful, in to his engagement than God? Rejoice, therefore, 
 in the contract that ye have contracted: for this shall be the great 
 bliss.  14:45, 1 October 2005"

 ::::By all means give me a reason why I shouldn't presume the worst from these admins, given what's happened to me. Perhaps you can have a go at filling out a response to the block review yourself, as a thought experiment. It's taking them a hell of a long time to do it after all, far longer than any of the other decisions that they've taken which involved bad things happening to me and my posts. Far far longer than doing anything about removing the attacks on Cornellier. Put yourself in the position of explaining how my 3 edits meets anything in WP:Disruptive Editting. Or explaining why reporting personal attacks like the ones I did is disruptive in any way shape or form, to the point of requiring immediate and undiscussed blocking. Perhaps have a go at explaining the preventative rationale behind that. Pick out any one of those 3 edits and tell me why a reasonable person would then label me a troll, which as I'm sure you're aware, is a pretty offensive term. As for this idea that there's no rule against calling someone an ignorant idiot or a fucking idiot or saying that you don't know your arse from your elbow, come on. They're some of the most blatant personal attacks as you'll ever see. And there's countless reams of policy that go into great detail about why you really can't accuse others of having called you a liar if they didn't, or of claiming you fabricated stuff when they didn't, or suggest they did something for motives that you don't and then won't substantiate, etc etc etc. I don't have a 'main account' right now, but you've pretty much hit the nail on the head - the tired old 'sock' panacea is what's in play here. Even then, you'll notice the policy it's a little more nuanced than 'if he doesn't look new - block on sight', and believe it or not, there is the basic principle that you not only have to be socking, you have to be doing something bad with it too, before you get blocked. Well, clearly there's been no dialogue here so they have no clue why I am familiar with Wikipedia and have instead gone for option 1. The second inconvenient part of WP:SOCK is pretty much being fudged here with this 'troll' nonsense and the attempted fit-up on the WP:DE charge. If they want to discuss all that though, they can do so after they remove the block. Or I can just create another sock and run this whole mess by people above their pay grades, to see if they see it the way I do - that Wikipedia's admins have somewhere totally got their priorities screwed and that this, probably like many other similar instances, is basically an open and shut case of 'shoot the messenger' if you can't deal with the message, then brush the message under the carpet.    

 == Administrator response times on Wikipedia == 
 * Time taken to notice and remove an instance of one editor calling another editor by name, an ignorant idiot in an edit summary - nobody knows, it hasn't happened yet (the removal; the noticing is being taken care of by dumping it into the memory hole as we speak) 
 * Time taken to misrepresent facts (""""hashed out"""") about the ANI report on said incident - 5 minutes! Although understandable given that giving an accurate response required reading this whole page 
 * Time taken to shut down the ANI report with a gibberish rationale - 7 mins 
 * Time taken to request an invasion of privacy on filer of ANI report - 16 mins 
 * Time taken to censor reasonable queries about the closure of the ANI report - 2 minutes! 
 * Time taken to block ANI reporter because his entire 3 edit history is disruptive editting (a long term behaviour as the page explains) - 1 hour 42 mins (the delay is not explained by any communication with said editor). The fact that it came 1 minute after me querying the closure of the ANI report, is surely coincidental!. 
 * Time taken to review block of ANI reporter - who knows. A couple of days?

 To Grsz:  I fail to understand why you undid my one sentence minor edit - and doing so without discussion is inappropriate, after all the discussions which went on before.  You said """"we dont really need a detailed account of the constitution"""".  Who is """"we""""?   

 A one-sentence explanation of why it's difficult to buy firearms in Mexico is highly appropriate to understanding the demand for smuggling firearms into Mexico - and not just by drug cartels.  Individual Mexicans have been smuggling firearms into Mexico for far over 100 years.  Since it's extremely difficult to buy them in Mexico, individuals still buy in the U.S. (for their own protection) and smuggle them into Mexico.   

 Frankly, I don't understand why you consider Mexidata an unreliable source - as you also previously considered any NRA publication to be unreliable.  Do you have another agenda that we should know about?  I'm presuming you are editing in Good Faith, but an explanation is in order.

 I have edited the article so that the primary definition of skeuomorphism given is the narrow one (an element that imitates something that was once functional in an older design), and I have relegated the broader definition of skeuomorphism (anything that looks like anything else) to being mentioned as an alternative definition later in the article. This is a reversal of the way the article has been for about a year, but I believe it was the correct choice for the following reasons: 
 * The narrow definition is the original definition of the term, and as far as I am aware it is the exclusive definition used by designers. 
 * Most of the content of the article is written for the narrower definition and doesn't make sense when applied to the broad definition. 
 * I don't believe the broader definition even existed until tech bloggers diluted it from the narrow defintion within the last few years. 
 * This article was written using the narrow definition and retained that definition up until mid 2012. Wiktionary still uses that definition as well. 
 * The broad definition is not useful as design term, as it has the exact same meaning as the word """"imitates"""". Using the broad definition then leaves no term to describe the specific cases that fall under the original, narrower definition of skeuomorphism. 
 I saw that somebody had started a discussion about this several months ago and it go no replies. I have decided to be bold and make the edit, and hopefully anybody who disagrees with it will be willing to discuss it here."""

c67d41d52fc7ef10,"== Origin of the name Bilbo == 

 This is a query I have related to another article and maybe you, Tolkien enthusiasts, may help. 

 The name bilbo appears in classical English as a type of sword (see Bilbo (sword)), which is mentioned by Shakespeare's character Pistol in the Merry Wives of Windsor: 
 :Ha, thou mountain-foreigner! Sir John and Master mine, 
 :I combat challenge of this latten bilbo. 
 :Word of denial in thy labras here! 
 :Word of denial: froth and scum, thou liest!  
 and is ethymologically linked to the Basque city of Bilbao (also known as Bilbo by locals and Bilboa in old English) 

 My question is: does anybody know for sure (and can document somehow) if Tolkien's name choice for this character was inspired by these cultural references (sword, Shakespeare)? I feel it's probably the case but I'd like to have more definite information, thanks."

 == Numbering Under Construction and Announced temples == 

 With the use of the data template for temples under construction - I think we should discuss the numbering issue again. Typically we have numbered temples on this page using the following rules 
 # Dedicated temples numbered as on lds.org 
 # Under construction temples by date of groundbreaking 
 # Announced temples by date of announcement 
 This means that temples that are announced but have difficulty getting started have a changing number as other temples have ground breakings and skip ahead. The same thing happens when a temple under construction is completed faster than ones started before it, since when it is dedicated its number changes to match the numbering on lds.org. Thus all temples numbered under 2 or 3 are tentative. 

 I think having the temple have a number on the temple's individual page that is tentative could be confusing - and at least one other person agrees as the data templates that have been created and used for Infoboxes sometimes say TBD for the number.  

 On the other hand the numbering doesn't really mean anything and we could continue the practice of italicizing them so that they are differentiated.  

 I plan to use the numbering that we have always used on this page unless there are substantive objections and consensus is reached on an alternative solution.  """

 # Put Wikipedia:Esperanza/December 2005 elections/Vote on your Watchlist (visit the page, then click """"watch"""" on the row of buttons at the top-middle of your screen. That way you'll see the most recent changes to the page. 
 # When you see a change, it's probably someone voting. Check the person making a vote is listed on this page. If they're not, edit the page, cut the vote out and re-post it on this page instead. Then write to the person and very nicely tell them what you've done and why (ie they're not a member). Be careful - the membership list is in plain-text, whilst the votes are signatures: peoples' account names and signature names sometimes don't match! 
 # If all is well with the vote, check the tally on the right side of the page and see if it matches the number of votes. If it doesn't, edit this page and bring the tally up to date. This page uses wikitables - as you're new, these may be a bit daunting, so feel free not to do this! 
 # If you spot a change has been made to the voting page and it looks like vandalism (someone removing votes, blanking the page, adding nonsense etc), revert the vandalism by going into the edit history, choosing the last good edit, clicking the date of that edit, """"edit this page"""" and save it. That goes back to the previous version. Put something like """"rvv"""" (re-vert-vandalism) or """"rv blanking"""" (re-vert blanking) as your edit summary. 
 # Voting is """"approval voting"""". No-one may vote """"against"""" or """"neutral"""". All votes must be signed and dated: you may have to pick through the edit history if you find one that isn't, then write to that person and ask them to sign their vote with ~~~~ for the avoidance of doubt. 
 # Always assume good faith on behalf of voters and candidates. Errors are likely to be simple mistakes that anyone could make.  

 If you spot anything that looks a bit odd or you don't know what to do about something, ask any one of the other Elections Staff for help or advice. The person in charge is , although we're all very happy to help. Thanks very much for volunteering! â¨ E """

 According to the OED, the """"ludicrous jest"""" version (n.4) is is not derived from Papal Bull: 

 """"No foundation appears for the guess that the word originated in âa contemptuous allusion to papal edictsâ, nor for the assertion of the âBritish Apolloâ (No. 22. 1708) that âit became a Proverb from the repeated Blunders of one Obadiah Bull, a Lawyer of London, who liv'd in the Reign of K.

 I'm sorry, but I don't know how to cite the OED, as I have the electronic version.    

  

 Oh wait, I take that back. This is how they have in the OED:

None of these are the kind of actors who most people would go 'oh looks its...' when they appear on screen. Note, this is no critisism of them, its just what they do for a living.

Once I got some smart people willing to put a lot of energy into creating [ course notes] and [papers] based on my seminars, messing around with newsgroups seems a bit too diffuse... sort of low-intensity.   

 I just want things to be intense, deep, and to get lots of people involved... but these goals conflict with each other, so I guess it's good to do lots of different things.  Graduate-level seminars on math and physics are great, but sometimes I want to talk to everybody!   I've got this """"hambone"""" side to my personality.   I'm considering some sort of """"moderated blog"""", and someone has offered to help me set it up. 

 when it comes to communicating ideas, there are lots of possibilities to explore these days, and most of them haven't even been tried.  Not everything is for everyone, but the best options probably haven't even been dreamt of yet!

 I think there should probably be an additional commentary on Marxist secularism, i.e. on Marxist interpretations of Church-State separation. Communist countries have often been refered to as atheistic in the Western press, but at home, they considered themselves to be merely secular states, secular states that applied Marxist ideology in public life. During the 1980s, as opposed to the two-way model that currently exists between the United States and France, there was often a third-way model of secularism that was promoted in the Eastern bloc states, which asserted the primacy of the State in all matters public, and considers religion to be a negative influence that is to be relegated to the private sphere, along with other undesirables such as capitalism."

  (ref- The Masks of God:Creative Mythology, Joseph Campbell, Penguin 1968, pp 158 - 167).   
 The above reference says that by the Middle Ages (11th century) there were Valentine Clubs in southern France. The valentine ceremonies bore some resemblence to rites that were practised by some cults of Hindus in India, indulging in the âFive Forbidden Thingsâ. One of these being choosing a partner by drawing lots in various ways - lots may be articles of clothing, names on slips of paper etc. This practice was done by some early Christian sects also, hence a refernce to Valentinian Gnostics of 2nd to 4th century Alexandra (Valentinus the founder fl. 137-166AD). So these Valentine practices probably originated in Christianity in second century, or earlier. And continued right thru to 11th to 14th centuries.  
 The reading is good if you can get the book, but I'm not so good to write a summary for Wikipedia. Also, some of the reported practices are a bit gruesome, but undoubtedly totally relevant to Valentines Day.  
 The other book  
 The Troubadours, John Rutherford, 1861- can read online Cornell University library - http://www.archive.org/stream/cu31924027291065/cu31924027291065_djvu.txt tells about Valentine Clubs and what they did. This one more light hearted.

 Because Abd, like me, is quite familiar with GoRight's case, and I believed his statement was relevant. Note that Abd was involved heavily in GoRight's RFC several years ago, long before the conflict which led to his ban, and Abd did extensive research which (IMO) exonerated GoRight against trumped up charges from Raul654 and WMC. This was a revival of that old conflict, and therefore I believe Abd had something to offer. 

 I think everyone needs to lighten up a bit. Abd's comment wasn't a wall of text, it wasn't uncivil, it just stated his opinion.

23cd33e32ef5b1d4,"The following is part of a letter written by Albert Fish detailing his encounter with Thomas Kedden (Warning: It is quite graphic): 

 Episode with 19 yr. old boy Thomas 
 Thomas Kedden  
 Kept him 10 days in room before finding the old house; 5 wks. there before leaving him. That was about 1910. First sadistic overwhelming. Intended to use him first, then torture him to death, then use the parts that appealed to me for food - I craved to hear someone scream & yell. About 25 years ago, or when I was 40 - I was doing a Painting job in Wilmington Del. I was rooming near Job on outskirts of city. Met a well built boy of 19. He had ran away from home in Arkansas on acct of being stripped naked and whipped by a brutal step Dad. He had a pretty face, would pass for 16 except for his size. Looked like a girl. He appeared to be kind of silly. He told me his story. Some one back home, told him he could get a job in Du Ponts. He beat his way in empty R.R. cars and by foot. When he got to Wilmington he was told no moore help were needed. He was silly in his actions and ways. Tho going on 20 and as strong as an ox. He was as easy to spank & switch as a boy of ten. He rode for two days in a banana car. Floor was covered with straw. Five men regular hoboes used him day and night. His behind was so sore from them it hurt him when he walked. He said all of them made him suck them off. At first he spit it out, but they beat him on his bare behind, with their belts and made him swallow it. He had the prettiest ad fattest behind I eve saw on a man. But he was covered from his neck down to his shins, with long black hair. You could hardly see his dickey or behind from hair. 
 When I first met him he had not a cent and was almost stoned, no place to lay his head. I took him with me, to the place where I got my meals and we had supper. How he did eat. I enjoyed watching him and filled him up. Then I took him to my room for just what I wanted. I knew he was Lousey for he could not stop scratching. I made him take everything off. He was full of the biggest lice I ever seen. His clothes were full, his shoes, and hat worn out, I threw them out. I let good warm water run in the bath tub, until it was half full. Then I made him get in and sit flat on his behind. I told him to stay there until I got back. I went to a drug store and got a package of hair remover in a powdered form. I had a pair of clippers and I cut all the long hair off him. Then I got a tin can dumped the powder in it and added water. This made a Paste. I smeared it all on him. Let it stand ten minuets. Then I made him sit down in tub and took a spongue and a cake of soap. I washed him good, then made him stand up. When I touched his back - belly - behind and Dick, every hair fell off. Then he was really naked and how pretty he looked. A nice big dickey and fat behind. I wiped him dry. Then rubbed him all over with hair tonic. I loved him then and kissed him all over 
 Then the fun began. It was a warm night and I went out and got a qt of ice cream. We eat about half of it. Then I stripped naked and got in bed. He kissed me in the mouth many times, my breast - belly - legs - dicky behind. I put ice cream in his behind and all on his dickey then licked it off. He done the same with me. Then I made him lay down on his knees, face down as I sat on side of bed. How sweet and pretty his bare naked ass looked to me. I kissed it a 100 times square in his sweet honey pot. Then I took my hair brush and used the back of it - to spank him. I made him yell ouch papa I will be a good boy. Yes I spanked him on his nice fat ass untied it, looked like a ripe tomato all over. Then it was his turn to be Papa. I was his boy and had done #2 in my pants. He gave me a bath then sat on side of bed and made me lay across his knees face down. He spanked my bare ass good and plenty. Made me yell - Ouch papa I wont do #2 in my pants again. I spanked him till he cried - he made me cry too. My ass was all red when he got thru. I saw it in the looking glass. How good it felt, when he spanked, but it hurt and I always wanted more and give him more. Nearly all night, we had fun. I sucked him off first, then he sucked me off. We played with each other and rested. Then I took Vasoline and smeared some in his behind also in my own. Then I stuck my dickey up his behind. He had a large sugar bowl and it went all the way up. How good it felt as I shoved it in. It slipped out once or twice. Then he did it to me. We put our arms around each other kissed and went to sleep. I bought him some clothes. That went on for about ten days. How I had whipped many boys and girls but they were gagged so they could make no out no cry. I craved for something different. I wanted to Lash - cut - burn a nice big fat pretty bare ass like Thomas had. Torture him, hear him scream with pain. I could not do it here- to many people. I began to look around.

 On the other hand, the BiH entry in ELL2 says that all three are official languages. The only problem is that there is so little detail that it's hard to know if this actually contradicts the other ELL2 article, or if it's simplifying matters by letting the names of the language stand in for the language. Arzoz has a similar problem. On the other hand, if the three were all separate official languages, why would they bother to say any more than that?

 Hi Fraudy, I just started on the article about Steve Lacy, the CEO of Meredith, and I am still working on it.

I have read through Wikipedia policies before starting this page, so I think this is OK as long as I am improving Wikipedia. I'd like to remove the tags when I finish, probably later tonight. I hope this is OK.

From reading the article, I garnered the impression that you either knew Steve Lacy or worked for him.  I encourage you to work on the article, but please try and ensure that it has a neutral point of view, so that it meets current wikipedia standards.  Thanks for your comment, and happy editing!

If I don't finish adding what I have tonight I will sometime tomorrow. Thanks again.

 We're sorry if the entry for Carbon Literacy doesn't meet Wiki's policies. The phrase has been in use for about three years now and is becoming more and more commonly used in discussions of the issue of climate change and in carbon trading circles. We had thought it would fit in nicely with Wiki's large environmental portal, climate change articles, and other resources. Perhaps in the future we can be included.  
 Thanks,

This was all about maintaining an international pecking order with the Chinese emperors at the top of the pyramid.

I point out shitty things about Korea to put voice into my statement that there is no reason to elevate your country over another. Loving your country is great, but it isn't while hating another.  

 It's true, I do have some sort of disdain for Korean society, Which still tries to clearly elevate one and lower the other. I can only feel remorse for the people that have to experience this sort of social rigor, rigor whereas people fight over name and identity. You always have to dress some way, act some way, and you have to be from a graduating class of a prestigious college to be recognized as a human being. People constantly fight over everything, constantly competing in gay things things like the company cook-off or fighting over the Bill after dinner. Fucking efficiency at the cost of equity. Korean kids at my school are hacking away at each other for the top, with their so-called diligence. 
 Haha, and other white kids ask me stuff like """" how come a Korean like you ain't got good grades, or do tons of community service hours, or not even go to expensive tutors for SAt? Well, It's simple; I can be successful and content with my life without having to violate social darwinism, l0l/

 I LIKEEEE SHITTTTTTTTTTT.!  âPreceding unsigned comment added by     

 While roaming around the web I found a mention that the term SHIT comes from the label on the side of boxes when it was being ttransferred from one side of the ocean to the other. The long and short... 

 Back in the early era, manure was recognized as being one of the best sources of fertilizer. As England expanded over the ocean, the demand for manure increased, causing captians to pack more and more into their boats. To prepare for the transatlantic crossing, the manure would be dried out to make it lighter (and eliminate the smell!) but as the boat transversed the ocean, water would leak in and get into the manure by soaking through the boat and te boxes. This would cause it to start decomposing, releasing methane and other gasses. While this wasnt much of a problem to the crews health, lighting a candle or other light source would cause an explosion, possibly destroying the ship. This led captains to label the side of their boxes """"Ship High In Transport"""" (S.H.I.T) This usage of terms eventually came to apply to manure in all forms.

But the wikipedia article does not mention the word Shit developing near the time of the black plague and this being the reason for its taboo. Does anyone know anything about this? Is the wikipedia article lacking or did South Park lie about history? Jon in California

And I didn't just 'overturn' concensus, but I actually took into consideration the RSN about this which said that trees themselves are not reliable, but the primary documents themselves are useful. This should not be hard concept to grasp, but in the discussion was geared towards 'primary documents' being OK (as under RS and other primary document criteria) and the 'family trees' made by amateurs are not reliable. All of the 'External links' were just a 'family tree', of which did not even cover Richard Tylman himself, but the presumed son and grandson as well. Poetic does not even have assess to the sources that he added, so even if we were to go for the better PRIMARY documents, the problem is that there is clear errors in the forms used and the best one represents a single line entry in a log book, and nothing more. Even the best source we have makes no mention about Richard Tylman being the mayor, and much of the prose here is wrong in its assertions. I'm not 'edit warring' and I haven't gone and addressed the OTHER issues because I don't want to deal with this every day I'm on wiki. And there actually SEEMS to be concensus about the links themselves not being reliable, which logically defaults to not being valid sources. Clemrutter even acknowledges this point as above. One of the 'includes' was a Sockpuppet and is invalid, yet it had no arguement either. The other was on the 'let readers decide if it is authoritive'.  
 :: If you want a proper gauge of the discussion, see the RSN entry as I noted. Its more obvious and detailed. Also the only two people who really made arguments were TFD and Poetic, both were active on the RSN debate as well. The fact three individuals on this RFC (which took place at the same time as the RSN debate) also have expressed concerns about the validity of the sources really defaults to the 3 Removes and 1 Yes (Poetic). A close with no concensus still equals removal. Either way, it doesn't change the result and no one on ANI or in the side discusses has dealt with the issues themselves, instead of the action of the close. Those who have expressed concerns with the sources did so in policy and knew that there really was no way they would have remained valid. Its because they do not pass RS, V and ELNO, not because I'm being a jerk. I could have closed it as 'no concensus' and still removed the things as according to policy. Instead I gave a solid answer on why TFD's argument won out in light of policy. Either way, if I closed as 'no concensus, removing links per policy' the outcome would have been no different to worse. Ironic thing, I don't even know why the previous incarnation of the poet Richard Tylman was deleted. It seems stupid to me and I have half a mind to try and resurrect the page, but Poetic is absent for now and I won't risk further ire by doing so. I'm not a 'bad guy', and I'm really level headed.

 == A few thoughts from a semi-amateur Wikipedian... == 

 Ok, so, I had read this article years ago, I thought it was interesting, I'm not at all offended by it or by the content. Nothing in Wikipedia offends me. But putting it on the front page... I feels like a stunt to me. Yeah, I know, Wikipedia is not censored. But as has been noted, the front page IS. Is a nude photo ever the featured picture? Is the infamous ejaculation .gif ever going to be shown on the front page? If the article warrants FA status, will we ever see """"Cunt"""" or """"Fuck"""" or """"Nigger"""", etc, as the front page featured article? I suspect not. 

 Add to that the fact that the front page is, essentially, off limits to edits from all but a select few... and thats a good thing! BUT there is a trust between vast majority of wikipedians who can't edit the FP and the few that can, and this make me think that trust might have been bent a little. Is it true, as has been mentioned, that the Jenna Jameson article, while a FA has been essentially blacklisted from ever being Todays FA? If that is the case, then there is some severe hipocracy going on here. 

 The whole thing actually strikes me a bit like, oh, Climbing the Reichstag Dressed Like Spiderman, maybe? It seems to me that people might be trying to make a point about policies such as """"WP is not censored"""" by promoting an article that is well written, academic and emotionless but still chock full of language that is offensive to a great many people.  

 I appreciate the argument that promoting such an article to the front page is a chance to show how mature and serious we are. But I can't shake the feeling that shock value has something to do with it.

If you would bother looking at the history of the space program, you would see the continued improvement in the technology over the decades. We stopped sending people to the moon because there was no longer any public support for the expenditure. The moon flights evolved into the Apollo-Soyuz program, the shuttle, and the various space stations, along with the far-ranging unmanned flights to the outer planets. Even some of the moonbats concede that we successfully placed a laser reflector on the moon. Why they continue to profess that we couldn't have similarly soft-landed a manned vehicle is beyond logic and reason. It comes down to simply a fanatical belief in their premise, which is based on nothing. What is it going to take to get that simple fact through your thick skull???

Does he have any? no. I do not know how you hold these two viewpoints concurrently, you write -  You need to look at your sources a bit harder. For example oilprice.com is produced by CNBC, which is part owned by General Electric.  Then when the tables are turned and they don't like it, they write  I'm not wasting my time on this rubbish in what can only be regarded as a nice display of routine inconsistency from my friend. Not a single reliable scientific source supports Sovacool, not a shred of support, However that which was published by oilprice.com is supported by numerous scientific publications which can be found in the Deaths/TWh section of this talk page. That useless rubbish Mojochan calls is a peer reviewed paper published by a team of actual certificate holding scientists in a scientific journal ( read- not the demonstrably misleading, scientifically discredited publications of an anti-nuclear lawyer). I've no doubt Sovacool is an academic lawyer, possibly even a good one at that, but an authority on nuclear power, warranting the amount of weight he is given in this encyclopedia article on nuclear power? Please. 

 :::::::I really never cease to be amazed by my friend mojo chan, how someone can call a peer reviewed paper a useless reference as they do is entirely beyond me. Everyone is free to read the paper by asking their local University nicely, that is, if they do not already have a subscription like many editors here do. All other editors, who are affiliated with a college, or ask nicely at their local College, can read it. Secondly, the opinions are not mine, they are of those who published the paper, and the paper is a correct exposure of how Sovacool's methods are unsound and statistically skewed. It is not a matter of disagreeing, it is a matter of whether or not he is consistent with his methodology, and factually correct. As Sovacool has a book on why he does not like nuclear power, and his publications have been discredited, he should be toned down in the article, as he is given too much weight. For example, his opinions in the decommissioning section and the greenhouse gas section of the article are not at all substantiated, the reality of affairs is in direct contradiction to his opinion.  

 ::::::: I wouldn't mind if he was factually correct on the issues he raises, and just had a differing viewpoint, that would certainly be fine(eveyone's entitled to their own view), but he is not factually correct, and therefore he is not encyclopedic. 

 :::::::  I disagree, you should expect truly reliable sources to be unbiased. Now, I'm not advocating Sovacool to be removed completely, on the contrary, I think he serves as a good example of the anti-scientific tactics used by some within the anti-nuclear power movement, and if pushed by someone I might even fight to keep him in the article if someone were to want to censor him entirely,(Something Mojochan is quick to do with many of my scientific sources). I'm simply  advocating that the references that lead to him, should be attributed to him, and that his undue weight in the article be toned down. Furthermore, and I cannot stress enough, it is really not a matter of viewpoint, it is a matter of whether or not what he writes is factually correct or not. He has been called out on numerous statements and publications of his by actual scientists, so therefore, whichever editor has included him so neurotically as often in the article as he presently is are pushing an unencyclopedic and factually incorrect source. Sovacool is given pride of place in the article, this would be akin to giving the likes of factually incorrect anti-global warming advocates or anti-vaccination advocates undue weight in the global warming and MMR Vaccine page, and stating their opinions as fact without first declaring according to Benjamin K. Sovacool... or in respect to vaccines, according to Andrew Wakefield.... So you really have to ask yourselves,  is it the job of an encyclopedia to give, (like the media do - because it sells paper,) equal weight to both parties - those that have the weight of evidence on their side, with those that are scientifically discredited. Or is it our job to give ~90% of the weight to those with the evidence on their sides, and ~10% to those that have been discredited. Controversy and debate may be juicer to some editors, but to me encyclopedias should rather be about actually displaying which side, the evidence supports/ which side is factually correct.

 ==wllm.com I cannot post?== 

 Hello, 

 I've tried 3 times (twice with Wordpress and once with no login) to reply to the wllm.com blog, but none of the replies have shown up.  Am I doing something wrong? - The non-appearing posts were calm, non-insulting, perhaps even boring, but I didn't save them before posting and I don't want to type them again and have them not show up. 

 We have not conversed before anywhere - I did sign up on Wikipediocracy a while ago to post a picture of Gordon Ramsey choking Greg Kohs, but by the time I finished signing up, the discussion had moved on and I never did post the photo there or post at all.  âÂ Preceding unsigned comment added by   â¢    

 Thanks, 
 Entlebucherdoodle. 
 : I'll check it out. Sometimes they go to a spam folder for various reasons.   

 ::Thanks - I can't remember the exact text, but I think there was a  < B > and a < /B > in there somewhere.     

 :::Thanks I was able to post on wllm.com - I think that when I remember/find my Wikipediocracy login information, that I will finally post the photo of Gordon Ramsey choking Greg Kohs on Wikipediocracy, I don't know where else to post it.  It is tasteful and not violent - Greg is smiling.    
 :::: It sounds like a pretty funny pic. I started a thread a while back while I was getting data points on whether Greg posing a threat at WikiConference 2014 was credible. Coincidentally, it was where I found out about the infamous boldfacing. He had apologized for it by that time. Then he unfortunately voided that apology as far as I'm concerned with his referring back to it an unapologetic way, although I did not- and still don't- believe he poses any physical threat whatsoever. In any case, I called it """"The Roast of Greg Kohs,"""" and it was pretty tame but for that one instance. He posted a picture of him posing next to a roast chicken. I suggest posting it on that thread.   
 :::::The roast chicken thread was where I was going to post the Gordon Ramsey Choking Greg Kohs photo (an actual non-photoshopped image) but by the time I had my Wikipediocracy account set up, the thread had moved on.  Did you ask Greg Kohs for his side of the """"he got"""" text before you made the """"Greg Kohs and Bigotry"""" blog post?  I frequently see text on legitimate journalism sites and newspapers such as """"xxxx did not reply to requests for comments before this issue went to print.""""  I understand that blogs don't have to have the same ethics as mainstream journalists, so that may be the reason.  It would be a lot of work if all the blogs on the internet were required try to get both sides of any post they made and they would be less popular.  I tried to read Donald Rumsfeld's autobiography some time ago and it was somewhat boring to read because on all of the major issues he would explain both sides of each argument to be made for actions that he took.  It would have been a much more """"enjoyable"""" read if he discussed only the reasons """"for"""" his actions and had left out the """"against"""" arguments.  So, I can understand why on your own blog you would present your own views on issues without trying to contact the subject of a defamatory blog post to get their side prior to publishing the post - if anyone wants to present their own side, they can set up their own blog"""".

 I agree. The norm is Greece is to refer to """"Greeks"""" in Turkey, while we speak about """"Muslims"""" in Thrace, which is obvious double standards. Not all of them are Turks, since Pomaks are NOT Turks, but some of them, I don't know how many, are. The official position of the Greek state, that this is only a religious minority has to be mentioned as well though, for completeness.  

 Having said all that, there is a very basic difference between Greeks in Turkey and Turks in Greece. After the pogroms of 1955 and the general ethnic cleansing policies of the Kemalist state, there are perhaps 1000 Greeks or less left in Turkey, most of them in Istanbul. The Greeks did NOT ethnic cleanse the Turks. Turks are perhaps a hundred times more and they occupy a large portion of two prefectures (Rhodopi and Xanthi). Greece, contrary to acquis communautaire and because of strict adherence to the Lausanne treaty, still lets the mufti perform lots of administrative and judicial duties. This, along with continuous propaganda from the Turkish state (the books in minority schools come directly from Turkey!), has made the minority a time-bomb inside Greece, waiting to explode.  """

Clearly, the study in question does a lot in explaining that the effects of thyroid hormones may actually be mediated by autonomous nervous system activity. But it is, together with PMID 18182466, a very early study into this phenomenon. It would need to be reproduced, perhaps in different models, before becoming suitable for inclusion into a general encyclopedia. In such a case, it would be much preferable to cite a secondary source (e.g. a review or a textbook chapter) that puts this interesting study in a wider perspective.

 See here: 

 """"The huge increase in coal-fired power stations in China has masked the impact of global warming in the last decade because of the cooling effect of their sulphur emissions, new research has revealed. But scientists warn that rapid warming is likely to resume when the short-lived sulphur pollution â which also causes acid rain â is cleaned up and the full heating effect of long-lived carbon dioxide is felt. 

 The last decade was the hottest on record and the 10 warmest years have all occurred since 1998. But within that period, global surface temperatures did not show a rising trend, leading some to question whether climate change had stopped. The new study shows that while greenhouse gas emissions continued to rise, their warming effect on the climate was offset by the cooling produced by the rise in sulphur pollution. This combined with the sun entering a less intense part of its 11-year cycle and the peaking of the El NiÃ±o climate warming phenomenon. 

 The number of coal-fired power stations in China multiplied enormously in that period: the electricity-generating capacity rose from just over 10 gigawatts (GW) in 2002 to over 80GW in 2006 (a large plant has about 1GW capacity). 

 But rather than suggesting that cutting carbon emissions is less urgent due to the masking effect of the sulphur, Prof Robert Kaufman, at Boston University and who led the study, said: """"If anything the paper suggests that reductions in carbon emissions will be more important as China installs scrubbers [on its coal-fired power stations], which reduce sulphur emissions. This, and solar insolation increasing as part of the normal solar cycle, [will mean] temperature is likely to increase faster."""" 

 Prof Joanna Haigh, at Imperial College London, commented: """"The researchers are making the important point that the warming due to the CO2 released by Chinese industrialisation has been partially masked by cooling due to reflection of solar radiation by sulphur emissions. On longer timescales, with cleaner emissions, the warming effect will be more marked."""" 

 The cooling effect of sulphur pollution on climate has long been recognised by scientists studying volcanic eruptions, which have, for example, caused failed crops and famines in the past. Sulphur dioxide forms droplets of sulphuric acid in the stratosphere, which increases the reflection of the Sun's heat back to space, cooling the Earth's surface. 

 The effect also explains the lack of global temperature rise seen between 1940 and 1970: the effect of the sulphur emissions from increased coal burning outpaced that of carbon emissions, until acid rain controls were introduced, after which temperature rose quickly. Some have even proposed sulphur dioxide could used to geoengineer the planet by deliberately injecting millions of tonnes into the atmosphere to combat warming. 

 The new study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on Monday, analysed possible reasons for the flat 1998-2008 temperature trend using climate models and concluded that it was unlikely to be due simply to the random variation inherent in the planet's climate system. Instead it found the effect of sulphur, the sun and El NiÃ±o dominated, with the El NiÃ±o climate phase peaking in 1998 â the hottest year ever recorded â then moving into a phase dominated by its cooler mirror image, La NiÃ±a. The scientists ruled out changes in water vapour or carbon soot in the atmosphere as significant factors. 

 They emphasised the rapid increase in coal burning in Asia, and in China in particular, noting that Chinese coal consumption doubled between 2002 and 2007: the previous doubling had taken 22 years. 

 Michael E Mann, at Pennsylvania State University and not part of the research team, said the study was """"a very solid, careful statistical analysis"""" which reinforces research showing """"there is a clear impact of human activity on ongoing warming of our climate"""". It demonstrated, Mann said, that """"the claim that 'global warming has stopped' is simply false."""" """"

 """"Bruno: A Glimpse into Zionism?""""

 Your assertion that including a tiny sample of his multitudes of anti Jewish comments is """"cherry picking"""" is nothing less than a lie. He begins his introduction to 'The erasure of Islam' by stating  

 """"After a decade of elaboration on Jewish ideology and identity I came to a conclusion that Jewish identity, politics and ideology can be grasped as different manifestations of âself loveâ."""" - Gilad Atzmon

 Is this section really appropriate in this article? This idea that the RHEL releases are somehow generated from a certain release of RHL or Fedora is not acurate. RHEL is based on whichever versions of applications have been proven to be stable together. Fedora DOES serve as a testbed for Redhat, but it is an application by application basis, not a """"Fedora 4 will become RHEL 4"""" test.

 == ?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?! == 

 What the heck? There is no reason for this maddening debate. Silversmith offered a compromise, lets just use both dates. All this hysteria and theoretical offense is bordering on trolling. Frankly I find the idea that we'd use anything other than A.D. and B.C. on the Jesus page rather offensive. 

 ''''''''''   

 :Please explain why you think that our NPOV policy should be suspended for the Jesus article? (But to reitterate, I do accept the """"use both"""" compromise, which you seem to endorse, as long as the difference between the two systesm is explained).    |    

 I obviously don't think that, indeed if we were to follow NPOV we'd ignore the bizarre """"I'm offended by A.D."""" POV, as being too small a minority view to include here, and discuss it on the Anno Domini article instead... Unfortunately NPOV is ignored early and often in favor of egocentrism on the wiki, much to our collective shame. If you want to see more of what I think, click . ''''''''''   

 :I am glad that you reall do accept that I find AD offensive â when some claim I am faking it, that is incredibly offensive.  I am, however, disappointed that you think that my being offended is """"bizarre.""""  That you do not share my reasons, or maybe do not underdstand my reasons, does not mean my views are irrational.  And to suggest so is not only offensive, it undermines our NPOV policy which requres that we do not judge (in articles, yes, I don't want to censor you on a talk page) views different from our own.  However, I take strong issues with your """"too small a minority view.""""  Not only is it not as small as you think, but as I have explained many times, NPOV is not based on numbers.    |    

 I don't think your views are irrational, I think they are bizarre (extremely abnormal and shocking). NPOV is NPOV. Our opinions as editors are not encyclopedic. Cite someone being offended already! ''''''''''   

 : If it's a question of being offended, I and I believe a number of other wikipedians were offended when this page was renamed from Jesus Christ to just Jesus. Given that """"Jesus Christ"""" is a well known appellation used extensively in literature and culture, to the point of even being used as a swear word, deleting """"Christ"""" from the title still strikes me as an attack on Christianity, not a search for something more neutral. The disambiguation notice currently says that the article is about """"Jesus of Nazareth"""", but I expect that to be challenged before long on the grounds that Nazareth supposedly didn't exist at the time Jesus was supposed to have lived there. Asking that """"AD"""" and """"BC"""" be purged seems to be part of the same jihad crusade campaign. And some will probably interpret my comment here as more reason to keep the article named just Jesus and to strike AD and BC.   

 For the record, Wesley, I do not remember what position I took on this but I certainly do not now object to this.  I mildly prefer """"Jesus of Nazareth.""""  I do have qualms about """"Jesus Christ"""" because many people, like Jews and Muslims, accept the existence of Jesus, and understand that Christians think he is Christ, but do not themselves think Jesus as Christ.  Nevertheless, I think at the time I argued in your favor (I think my argument was, if we have an article on Queen Elizabeth, it doesn't mean we all consider her our sovereign).  So I sympathize with you on the Christ as Title issue.  I am, however, still strongly opposed to BC/AD.  Sam asks me to cite someone offended.  Here goes: 

 Sam, please keep in mind that many â over twenty â voted for BCE/CE above, and that I have written hundreds of words explaining my position,  You don't need to read everything I wrote, but if you pick any big chunk of text you will get the idea.  In the meantime, see  for this: 
 :[1] B.C. stands for """"before Christ"""" and AD, stands for """"Anno Domini"""": """"in the year of the Lord."""" Both are references to Jesus. Because Jews do not believe in the divinity of Jesus, they use the abbreviations B.C.E., for """"Before the Common Era"""" (that is, before the year 1), and C.E., for """"Common Era"""" (that is, after the year 1).

Ecocities can be considered a subset of sustainable cities, but I believe warrant their own Wikipedia entry due to a unique methodology that places the city in it's natural environmental context. Ecocities are more than """"sustainable"""" in that they seek to return underutilized land (suburbs, freeways, etc.) to nature.  As such, they incorporate deconstruction (or revitalizing nature) as much as construction.  There is a fairly rich literature base on the topic and growing use of the term in the construction of new cities in Asia and the Pacific.   
    

 :Ecocity redirects to this article right now. That was the proposal by  josei and after some discussion and agreement, someone went ahead with that. You then recreated the """"Ecocity"""" article and wrote the text that I've since moved here (I put Ecocity back to a redirect).  

 :So we are discussing the merit of a separate article for """"Ecocity."""" You make the case that building an  Ecocity implies particular principles and actions, whereas, calling something a """"sustainable city,"""" may not. That sounds like the argument that Ryandwayne and I made (above) with respect to """"Ecovillages"""" and """"Eco-municipalities."""" While clearly ecovillages are a distinct entity, I've been editing the """"eco-municipality"""" article and realize that, while many of its advocates argue that it is unique (because the municipality adopts certain principles in its charter), in reality it is very hard to distinguish an eco-municipality from an ecocity. And, of course, the media fail to make the distinction at all. That's where I'm at. I'm not married to any one approach, so let's work it out here. Could you elaborate on your phrase """"more than sustainable""""?     

 If it's decided not to use significant portions of the article pasted above, if it's not suitable for Wikipedia, could someone please either move it to Appropedia, or leave a note for me and I'll do it. It's good content, but I don't think much of it satisfies Wikipedia's criteria.    âPreceding comment was added at  """

 == Anton, you might want to reconsider your edits to Haydar == 

 A disambiguation page for names is perfectly normal. Look, for instance, at Rani. The problem with the Haydar page is that Shi'a Muslims wish to annex it for Ali ibn Abi Talib, for whom there is already a long article. Nobody in Wikipedia gets two articles. However, there are a number of Haydars or Haiders with articles, and any reader who wants to find the right one can use the disambiguation page to get there.

 Also, you seem to have deleted a chunk of the talk page.

I have repeatedly stated the reason on the talk page, now if your going to start pretending to be superior and judge everyone else's edits, I suggest you yourself look at the discussion on the talk pages, and take a NPOV stance. 

 

 :Jadger, after looking at it in more detail it does look like this issue would have been better settled by the people who know the issues in detail. The particular reasons I interpreted this as vandalism were: 1) there was an active debate around the issue on the discussion page and at the same time (which on a second reading I recognize is more of a consensus toward removing the quote) 2) the deletion of what seemed to be valid and relevant content still under discussion without a 'see talk' notice in the summary 3) a warning on your talk page for deleting comments from the same page which made it sound like a revert war and 4) I've seen a rash of POV deletions that minimize or ignore killings of ethnic minorities.   

 == Reed College page == 

 I do not understand why you reverted teh Reed Talk page and put a """"blank"""" notice on my Talk page.  If you had taken two seconds, you would have seen that: 1) All the comments are already in the archive; and 2) The ArbCom dispute concerning them is all but complete, and the refactoring has not been found to be a problem.  So unless you explain, I will go ahead and archive the redundant comments.    
 :Gnetwerker, the issue on the talk page seems to be an open discussion between you and IronDuke. The refactoring process you are using doesn't seem to agree with this policy: Wikipedia:How_to_archive_a_talk_page. At least, I would suggest a link to the archives at the top of the page, and erring on the side of not removing discussions from an article talk page, especially if the issue is still being discussed.   
 Again, if you had taken the time to research the issue you would have discovered that: 1) There is a link to the archived page at the top of the Talk page; and 2) the dispute has been resolved by ArbCom with no finding that the refactoring was inappropriate.  Finally, IronDuke has gone away.  I would thank you to take the time to educate yourself on the issue if you choose to intervene further.

  By the Egyptian Engineer/Tour guide/ HANY HALIM patented in Egypt in 2002  

  
  IT has always puzzled me to see the amazing joints between the stones of the 
 pyramids, especially those used for the outer cladding.  Close inspection reveals  
 that you cannot insert a pin or a sharp razor blade in between the stones and I  
 believe that they were probably meant to be water-tight in order to prevent  
 water Leakage into the building. 
     They adhere perfectly to each other with no cement at all 
   The question that nagged me was how the Ancient Egyptians managed to do that with such great precision? 

  
 NOT only this but also they had to be able to put 
 ONE STONE EVERY TWO MINUTES in its place continuously for  
 25 years working 10 hours a day(see Calculations at  

 HOW TO ACHIEVE this HIGH SPEED OF WORK TOGETHER WITH  
 THIS VERY HIGH PRECISSION??!! 
  THIS IS THE DIFFICULT QUSTION THAT PUZZELED THE MINDS 
  of the world for a long time with no logical, or generally accepted answer 
 
 WELL now  
 Letâs notice what happens if we break a vase into pieces then try to fix it by putting the pieces back and gluing them. 
 If we do a good job, it will be difficult to tell where the cracks of the joints are, weâll probably see a hair-line crack where we canât insert a pin or a sharp razor blade.]]Isnât this exactly the same case as the cladding stones used in covering the pyramids? If we follow the same technique to build the pyramids 
 We would Break the quarry into pieces, move it to the construction site and put the pieces back next to each other as they were in the quarry, achieving both the high speed and great accuracy.

 * It is not encyclopedic because, by capturing the rate on an arbitrary date, no useful understanding of long term price is conveyed to the reader.  
 
 The historical exchange rates (since 1990) that are given in Exchange rates section of the Economy of the United Kingdom entry. are far more useful.

He'd use bottom-of-the-barrel """"sources"""" to support these claims, which anyway struck me as trivial: after all, what business is it of an encyclopedia to discuss the sex acts (even if proven) of a musician? (As opposed to those of, say, a self-proclaimed defender of so-called """"family values"""".) Now he's going on about the relationship of Presley to black music, which, at least potentially, seems an encyclopedic concern, and whatever the value of what he claims to be citing, at least it's not obvious crap. 

 But perhaps I've missed something. 

 Meanwhile, the talk page and sometimes the article are degraded by the tantrums of some AOL person who seems to regard Presley as an obstacle to world recognition of the supereminence of that other wholesome, white artiste, Michael Jackson. Given autocratic control over W'Pedia, I'd immediately block edits from the IP, for chronic trolldom and terminal boringness. I realize that his talk page says AOL users often change IP addresses with each page they load. Warnings or messages left on this page will not likely be received by the intended user. However, the evidence is strong that most of his edits are from either of two IP numbers; blocking both would I think carry little risk of preventing worthwhile edits to W'pedia.   04:48, 18"""

 ::::There is a difference between the Caucasus as a geo-political area and the Caucasus as a geographical mountain range. The Caucasus article only says that the geo-political area is located """"at the border of Europe and Asia"""". This is because the mountain range is usually considered to be the boundary between the Europe and Asia (see the sources I have previously provided). While Chechnya, Dagestan etc. are located on the northern side of the mountains, Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia are located south of the mountains. This is reflected in the map used in the article Europe. The Eastern Europe article only says that the Caucasus states are """"sometimes"""" included in Eastern Europe - """"sometimes"""" is not the same as """"usually"""", and the article includes this map based on UN sources. That map does not include the three transcaucasian states in Eastern Europe.

 ====Yes â Yes (band)==== 
 This move has already taken place by doing a copy/paste. Someone needs to delete the Yes (band), which was a redirect to Yes, and then move the Yes to [[Yes (band). The reason for this request is that the vast majority of edits to Yes were related to the band and not the word.    
 *Yes is currently a simple dictdef.  Yes (band) should be at Yes with a link to Wiktionary for the word.    
 **I have no problem with that. I didn't move the article, I just wanted to get the page history straightened out.   
 *I've reverted it, and left a note on the Talk page to bring the argument here, and to use the Move tab if it should be moved. IMHO, someone looking for the word will go to Wiktionary, while someone looking for Yes at Wikipedia is more likely looking for the band, so I think it should stay that way. (i.e. 'what violet/riga said')   
 **That works for me.   
 *Support move to Yes (band). Yes should be a disambig. See Yes (disambiguation) for some ideas.    17:04, 2005 Jan 1 (UTC) 
 *Unless someone presents some other well-known things known only by the name Yes, then the band should be at Yes. I see nothing at Special:Allpages/Yes that would be referred to primarily (or even occasionally) by only the word Yes. â   
 *I was the original editor, and I'm willing to admit that I may have goofed.  I saw some similarity between Yes and Rush, both of which are common words with other uses, but I admit that the band may be the commonest use of Yes.  A quick search at IMDB, for instance, showed one art-house film, some foreign films, and a couple of shorts.  And I probably didn't wait long enough for a consensus, didn't use """"Move"""", etc.  I haven't been around here long enough to know which way the precedents point.   
 *Yes. Support the move.  06:42, 2005 Jan 3 (UTC) 
 *Support the move. As the name of a band, 'Yes' will only be known to a minority of readers.

ed49ac742ff38b13,"""::The comments below explore various aspects of the same question:  If no reliable published source (as yet) affirms """"a marginal Italian victory,"""" how does that claim meet Wikipedia's threshold for inclusion (see Wikipedia:  Verifiability)? 
 ::* How can the reliability of four published sources be """"put in doubt"""" without evidence?  How would """"updated"""" sources """"distance themselves from war propaganda""""? 
 ::* In the article and on this talk page, the convoy battle of MW10 (3/21 - 3/26/1942) is conflated with the Second Battle of Sirte (3/22/1942).  References that would corroborate that unity are """"[p]ractically all the books previously cited"""" (item 2, 04 May 2007) and """"all the reliable sources cited here"""" (second bullet, 22 June 2007).  Why not more specific citations?  By contrast, that the convoy battle and the Second Battle of Sirte are separate events is supported by specific citations from eight reliable published sources (item 2, 17 June 2007).  With this 0-8 record, how does combining the convoy battle and the Second Battle of Sirte meet Wikipedia's threshold for inclusion? 
 ::* The claim that the Second Battle of Sirte """"was a marginal Italian victory"""" seems to be not a """"synthesis of facts or sources,"""" but rather an """"analysis . . . of established facts, ideas, opinions, or arguments in a way that builds toward a particular case favored by an editor, without attributing that analysis . . . to a reputable source"""" (see Wikipedia:  No original research).  Further, Bragadin and Woodman seem to use """"fatal"""" in a limited sense:  Bragadin to refer to the March 23 Axis air attacks that sank Clan Campbell and contributed to the sinking of Southwold (166) and Woodman to refer to just the latter (308).  More to the point, though, which reliable published sources credit the Italian fleet's intervention with having had any but the most indirect effect on the fate of the remaining three ships of the convoy?  Also, how is it """"just a 'research'"""" if no primary or secondary sources state the Italians won a marginal victory?  On a related topic, the U-Boat analogy seems strained since the circumstances bear little resemblance to those at issue here.  Moreover, the analogy seems to assume (without proof) that """"some other sources"""" are biased in favor of the """"allies point of view,"""" and therefore editors should not be compelled """"to cite only the allies version of the facts.""""  But, how is this position consistent with verifiability?  On another tack, if reliable published sources expressed no opinion about who won the Second Battle of Sirte or if sources were divided about who won, the article could simply reflect that non-opinion or divided opinion.  However, in this case, six reliable published sources state the British won, while none (as yet) affirms """"a marginal Italian victory.""""

Then, I saw it get deleted and the discussion page got deleted too. Then I thought """"I MUST EXACT MY REVENGE!!!"""" So, I created account after account, realizing how fun it was to troll Wikipedia and antagonize admins like you, SV, Shanel, Pilotguy, DakotaKahn, etc. I actually made very few vandalous edits (<10?) But ended up creating about 500 accounts with crazy usernames. I actually don't support Nazism, but just made those usernames to troll with. I did not use ANY bots, entirely by hand, courtesy of AOL. I created various identities, such as Johnny Knight, SPAM-MAN, Dr. Destructo, admin-attacking names, etc. And I observed the anger and then I thought: this is so fucking fun! I got over 100000 IP addresses blocked (205.188.0.0/16 and 64 something /16) Tonight, I was going outside to take out the trash, when I heard  this ghastly moaning sound coming from my backyard. Naturally, I was curious, so I walked over there................and MY WORST FEARS WERE REALIZED, I saw this teenage girl, a complete stranger, giving birth alone to an extremely deformed baby in my backyard. The girl died shortly thereafter from excessive bleeding (hemorrhage). I ran to the house, got my mom and called 911! The girl was pronounced dead at the scene by the 911 people. Anyway, then I thought, maybe I'll troll Wikipedia some more to ease the fears so I could go to bed, but I checked your user talk page, since I had been trolling you and Wikipedia for about a week. I saw I had become a bit [in]famous, but then I read about how AOL might put in the XFF headers, and I thought SHIT HOW WILL I EVER EXPLAIN THIS, and WHAT IF COLLEGES FIND OUT (I'm 15). The same thing once happened to me when I used to vandalize guestbooks (of completely random strangers) months ago and gradually got bored with it. One guy threatened to come after me with """"his boys"""" and I used the alternate identity of """"Joe Schmuck"""". And I thought, WHY THE FUCK AM I DOING THIS???!!!

 == Desarguesian spaces == 

 I reverted the good faith edit which stated that Galois geometries are usually called finite Desarguesian spaces. This is not a true statement. Only in two dimensions is there a need to distinguish Desarguesian planes from other projective planes. As soon as the dimension gets to be three or more Desargues theorem is automatic and there is no reason talk about Desarguesian spaces, as every projective space is Desarguesian. Also, the term Galois geometry has always been applied to geometries defined over fields (especially finite ones) whereas the Desarguesian geometries are defined over skewfields and it just happens that the finite skewfields are fields, this is not true in the infinite case, so there is some reason to keep the terms seperate. And while I'm at it, the article makes it sound like Thas and Hirschfeld invented the term """"Galois geometry"""" - this implication would embarass them both. The term, as far as I know, comes from the Italian school of geometers. Most likely B. Segre is responsible, but that is only a guess.   """

86eecf4032769034,"There is an article on the Big Bad Wolf. 

 Isn't it self-evident? Dogs become dangerous animals if they are mistreated or threatened, and dog teeth can do considerable damage to human flesh. The claws can lacerate flesh, and infection is a possibility with any animal bite or scratch. Dogs can overpower people with falls that can cause bone fractures. Dogs are much better-behaved than any other animals capable of killing and eating people... but where human stupidity meets a large predator, tragedy is always a possibility even if the predator is ordinarily well-behaved. The threshold for retaliation from a dog is far higher than for bears, wolves, cats, hyenas, snakes, seals, or crocodilians; in some cases, simply passing by makes one prey to some of those killers. Dogs know better and usually avoid confrontations, but even they have limits of tolerance. They defend themselves and their companions forcefully. 

 You wouldn't throw stones at a large dog, would you? Such is either amorality or profound folly. QED."

Two years ago, the discussion was very close, but in the end the closer opted not to slight Latin Americans, and closed as no consensus. That seems to have been less of a concern n the discussions this time, so arguments have focused on the historicity angle. It will be interesting to see what happens this time.

I will be bold, and re-add, and will link another essay to the eponymous Christ's Hospital.

 I would like to inform you that the NPOV discussion about the List of oldest universities in continuous operation, to which you participated, was reopened on the NPOVN. 

 The current discussion is ongoing on Wikipedia:Neutral point of view/Noticeboard#The List of oldest universities in continuous operation (again). 

 Regards,"

7d92326334a10c7a,"Well the other users on this page are trying to apply science to the fiction.  But since the writers write what they feel like writing, without consulting a university staff of astronomers and astrophysicists, they come up with immense errors.  Star Trek is about the stories, this fiction, and the science would be secondary.  Don't take my word for it though ask the people who wrote it.  The next generation technical manual clearly states the writer's position on it in the forward."

 I think that Adolf Hitler was a man with many """"issuse"""" this resulted in him being very unstable. I also think that he was amazingly clever, think about it this man out smarted a whole democracy, remeber every thing he did before he became dictator of germany in tearms of how he over threw the goverment was perfectly leagle. I think that people don't give this man enough credit, I know he killed many inocent people, but he also did a lot of good... remember before he started the war he did sort the shambles of a german econamy out.  âPreceding unsigned comment added by

 Many blacks from the Rhineland and the 'rhineland bastards' as they were termed by the Nazi state were sterilized under Nazi rule.  

 How come they do not appear on the other victims section? 

 == Hitler: not """"right-wing"""" and not """"left-wing"""" == 

 Before I even begin, let me make mention of the fact I am not speaking out of personal bias or political interest. I am neither a """"Conservative"""" or """"Liberal"""", and do not affiliate with the political """"right"""" or """"left"""". I also do not support either mainstream political party in the United States. 

 This article states, implies and attempts to reinforce several times that Hitler was, in some way, a """"right-wing"""" extremist or """"Conservative"""". 

 """"The Weimar Republic had never been firmly rooted and was openly opposed by right-wing conservatives (including monarchists), communists and the Nazis."""" 

 ...that also seems to imply that communists and monarchists are also """"right-wing"""", which is untrue. 

 """"Another candidate was a Communist and member of a fringe right-wing party."""" 

 ...here we go again... 

 """"Bal Thackeray, leader of the right-wing Hindu Shiv Sena party in the Indian state of the Maharashtra, declared in 1995 that he was an admirer of Hitler."""" 

 ...now I have to question the idea that Hindu Shiv Sena is actually a """"right-wing"""" party. It all depends on who's writing the article I suppose. If it's a """"Conservative"""", he'll turn out to be a batty commie. If it's a """"Liberal"""", he magically turns out to be a far-right, racist koo-koo. 

 Other articles all throughout Wikipedia have the same """"spin"""" attached to them, but it's outside the scope of this appeal for the most part. However, if you go to the """"far right"""" article, you are bombarded with the idea that """"Far Right"""" means such things as racist, authoritarian, totalitarian, militant, etc. This is simply untrue, just as untrue as saying the """"Far Left"""" is all about creating Soviet-like, autocratic states and domestic oppression.  

 The whole concept of wrapping all political ideals (and politicians) into the simpleton's explanation of politics we call """"wings"""" is misleading and inaccurate. The definition changes from person to person, viewpoint to viewpoint and even country to country. Therefore, I think it wise that Wikipedia stay clear of treading this ground except where it is absolutely necessary. Here it is not. We need only describe what Hitler believed, what happened and what he did. There is great debate among political scientists about how Hitler, Nazism and """"fascism"""" should be classified; or if it is even possible by conventional means. The very concept of """"left-wing"""" and """"right-wing"""" comes from the French Revolution, where the """"right"""" meant those who sat on the right and supported the king (monarchists). This was obviously not a good thing to be at the time. The definition of """"right-wing politics"""" grew out of that, and has never been defined neutrally. When you define the position of your opponents, you tend to set up a straw man. The spectrum itself is inherently flawed to begin with; no real political spectrum could be linear. It totally ignores the complexities of political science and makes no attempt at explaining how particular groups can be identified with one """"side"""", yet interpolate between the """"wings"""" on particular issues. If it were presented to Wikipedia today to be verified, it would be rejected. 

 So I STRONGLY suggest we remove ALL talk about what """"wing"""" people were from the article. It will only serve to confuse, mislead and even offend. It contributes absolutely nothing to the article and its information; save possibly advancing the political positions of the writers.  âPreceding unsigned comment added by  ([[User talk:67.142.163.29|"

In fact, most people who *have* heard of him have probably *also* not read the predictions, only descriptions of them in works which will generally seek to ascribe to them a particular impression (for instance XXX refers to event YYY). 
 :What does this mean? Basically that these people do not recieve a balanced perspective of alternate ideas as to how each prediction may be interpreted. Under these circumstances a reasonably logical person presented with only matrials written from a postive perspective could not be faulted for 'believing the prophecies' - i.e. the opinion of the majority, even *if* of the direction you identify, is irrelevant.

6aea9ab7d0b8b527,"In reply: I created that page. It was not intended to be frivolous and was certainly not vandalism. Nor do I believe it was nonsense. It was intended to be a stub for an exploration of the psychological and social causes that make wikis and similar collaborative tools appealing to some individuals but not to others. I apologize for not getting back sooner to the task of extending it. However, as Ward Cunningham has noted, one of the appealing facets of wiki is that contributions can be made in increments of paragraphs and sentences. 

 The impetus for creating the article came from my own experience administering private wiki's for corporate clients and non-profit organizations.  I noticed that only a small percentage of the potential users actually made contributions to the wiki and that, in some cases, there was outright resistance to the concept that persisted even after the usual concerns about vandalism and accidental deletion had been addressed.  As an ardent advocate of wiki and group collaboration technologies, I wanted to create a page that might attract contributions from others more knowledgeable than myself in organizational and behavioral science.  

 It's one thing for someone reading the page to consider it nonsense. The content was incomplete and I may well have written unclearly. However, I would have expected that an appropriate NPOV response would have been to add content to the page explaining what, specifically, was deemed nonsensical. Another possibility would have been to move the content to another page dealing with related behavioral issues. By the way, I searched Wikipedia and the web looking for similar material before creating the page, but did not find anything apropos.  

 In any case, deleting the page and accusing me of vandalism seems entirely out of line."

bb2a79235a09abb8,"::I agree there are difficulties in interpreting the position of the N. in region 2. This is what Capdeville tried to cope with. 

 ::I wish to attract your attention to the following points which might help in making things clearer: 
 ::1) The councils of Iupiter are 2, not 3. Consentes Penates consensiones(1) and involuti, superiores or Novensiles, Favores O.(2). Sources are clear about this. Arnobius III 38, 39 (44), 40; Martianus I 41 and 45; Festus sv. Manubiae; Seneca NQ II 41 etc. Iupiter has no advisory council in region 3 as he need not one: he may throw the mildest fulmen consiliarium of his own accord. Secundanus means precisely that he is here in his most favourable attitude. I do not see why you talk of 3 groups (the Favores Opertanei being considered equal to the superiores involuti Novensiles by C.). 
 2) I have a personal hypothesis concerning the inversion of positions of Consentes and Novensiles. Namely the Consentes are the Penates Iovis so they must reside in his own domus: as you know the Penates are the gods who make anybody exist: the Etruscans knew 4 kinds: Iovis (heavenly god's), Neptuni (earthly god's), Plutonis (underworld's god) and man's. So it is necessary for them to reside in region 1. The Novensiles on the contrary are in region 2 since this is the place praeter domum Iovis, quod etiam sublimis est i.e. Martianus wants to make it explicit they are located outside the house of Iupiter. Varro says somewhere the number 9 is the most powerful and belongs to the highest heavenly position. Thus they are both outside as N. and inside the house of Iupiter as Favores O. 

 ::Lastly I wish to remark that C. is not a correct scholar. He omits to acknowledge Dumezil already suggested the identification of the 2 councils  concerned with lightningbolts with the Consentes Penates and Favores Opertanei (the last for the most destructive manubiae) in ARR appendix. Moreover he does not cite A. Grenier's identification of the same most powerful council with the Novensiles in the famous article I used. Please cf. my former contribution above."

 == CBTC projects update == 

 Hello, 

 I have noticed that some of our CBTC projects â radio based / moving block principle - were missing in the article.  
 Here are some example  ShangaÃ¯, Milan, Beijing, Mexico, Toronto, DubaÃ¯, Panama, Hong Kong, etc. 

 As you are one of the most active editor of this article and already did an impressive work, I didn't want to be rude by editing these data by myself. 
 Then I have decided to forward you our data for your reference. 

 Should you need any additional information, I would be glad to help. 

 Kind regards, 
 S.Shirlaw

 Nelle Hunt is listed as joint 99th with Helen Stetter both died age 113 years, 195 days. However, Hunt has lived for 41,468 days where as Stetter has only lived for 41,467. This would mean they both died at the same age but Hunt lived 1 day longer. Wouldnt this make Hunt 99th and Stetter 100th? I think this should be the case. After the recent addition of Catherine Hagel, shouldnt Stetter be eliminated from the list?    

 :GRG lists these people by year/day, and ranks them accordingly. While there may be a good argument to make that counted by days, Stetter should be off the list, this is not how GRG sees it. So, to rank them that way would be original research. And, to further complicate matters, GRG has done a calculation of days for these people (from 2006) and the counts differ from what appears on this page. For this reason I believe we should eliminate the day counts until GRG decides otherwise.    

 :I am agreeing with Canada Jack.  I initially thought it made sense to posibbly remove Helen Stetter and just keep Nelle Hunt in the 100 position, but our agreement with the GRG is to view individuals by their """"year and days"""" totals irregardless of what appears in the """"age in days"""" column.  So Helen Stetter and Nelle Hunt are looked at as being equal.  So until someone else appears on the list, both will remain tied in the 100 position.  Thanks.

7313878c513554ef,""" the facts to be known.  

    

 *  . The  tag does not mean a personal dispute, only that the *content* may be questionable, which you just pointed (some) is. At the present moment I have nothing compeling me to engage in any kind of fact checking or mediation, I don't have the time nor the energy for that. I'd recommend that if there is only two editors contending for inclusion or exclusion of some content, that you try asking for help at the third opinion page. The Neutral Point of View Noticeboard may also be helpful. Nevertheless, I did a quick check on the given reference - as it is in Portuguese it would be harder for a 'random' editor to check it. The site seems to be a legitimate site from the Portuguese Minitry of Finances (I checked the whois record) and the documents content is as reported by you, it shows records of wages from 1948 and 1949, and the letter from the services does mention payments up to April 1954. Anyway, it would be much much better to present secondary sources, as we are not supposed to be checking primary sources -    

 Response: Thanks again for the heads up. I've just added two secondary sources. Besides the Amabassador Fernandes book, I've added the Douglas Wheeler article (Wheeler is endorsed by the Sousa Mendes Foundation) and I've added a letter from Sousa Mendes himself where he sais that he was using his salary to help his son Pedro Nuno. (the letter is from 1950 and is referenced in Fralon's book, (Fralon is also endorsed by Sousa Mendes). 
 The problem with secondary sources is that most of them are wrong. Like Avrahm Milgram says: Someone printed the 30,000 and bum, from then on 30,000 is the undisputed truth, even when the """"Shoah Resource Center, International School for Holocaust Studies"""" publishes a study saying that 30,000 it is a myth. 

 Nobody wants to raise his voice and run the risk of being accused of being Fascist or anti-semit. I've already been tagged of """"Salazar admirer"""", which I am not. Salazar was for """"censor"""" I am not. 

 Anyway the """"dispute"""" ended up being good. A lot more information surfaced.  

 Maybe one day someone will update the Portuguese, French and Spanish pages, with a lot of facts that have been kept hiden. 

    

 It seems that the dispute on if the Portuguese Government had, or had not, kept on paying to Mr. Sousa Mendes is full salary is now over. Sousa Mendes kept on receiving his full salary until the day he died and that salary was updated every year according to inflation, just like the salary of any other consul. In 1940 Sousa Mendes was being paid 1,523 Esc and the day he died he was receiving 2,304 Portuguese Escudos. Now that Mr Redmoon (former âSousa Mendes Foundationâ) had a week-end to analyze the documents that are very difficult to dispute, and is now editing again the article but not disputing this fact, it seems we can close it.   

 Anyway I am also organizing the documents of the court order of â2Âº âJuizo Civil da Comarca de Lisboaâ that ordered to retain 750,60 Esc per month from Mr Sousa Mendes Salary because of legal action raised by Sousa Mendes creditorâs. (Banks)  

 What we should now dispute is the number of visas. The 30,000. Well, Mr Redmoon is constantly quoting a research that is being conducted in the USA but that until now has not yet been published and the information available online only points in the same direction as the study published by the  """"Shoah Resource Center, International School for Holocaust Studies"""" that tags the 30,000 as a myth. 

    

 :Hey Nabla â November 16, youâve tagged the âSousa Mendesâ article as disputed. The dispute was if Portugal kept (or did not kept) on paying to Sousa Mendes a monthly allowance until the day he died. Since then Iâve added to the article several secondary and primary sources that prove that Sousa Mendes kept on receiving a generous monthly salary for the rest of his life. The other editor (Redmoon660 (note that Redmoon660 is a name change from """"Aristides Sousa Mendes Foundation), probably because of the discredit that fall upon him, stopped editing on that same day and I suspect he resurrected as editor âCoimbraloveâ also on the same day.  
 :The Sousa Mendes article is now one of the Wikipedia articles with more references. I wonder if it makes sense to keep on having the article as âdisputedâ.

 The Southern Kuriles are officially claimed, but what I was referring to was all of the Kurile Islands. That's why I didn't use the word """"southern"""" in my original post. 

 As for a new article, I would suggest being cautious as I foresee the unofficial list being filled up quite quickly with a lot of fringe / unsubstantiated claims. So it would be better to leave the current pages as is, and start a new List of unofficial territorial disputes.    """

There has been much discussion before (see the talk page archoves) and there is no reason to show anything but an unaltered average looking penis as the main photo. It would seem stupid to have discussion about the human penis structure including the foreskin and have it illustrated with a circumsised penis. It would make good sense to show the differences between a circumsised penis and uncircumsised penis in the section that deals with circumsision and also in the circumsision article.

 According to Conservative peer Michael Ashcroft, some currently unpublished photographic evidence, and as reported in many of the British newspapers, Cameron sexually assaulted a dead pig during his student days at Oxford University.
