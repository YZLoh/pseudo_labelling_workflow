 2) You didn't present any direct argument as such above  instead you merely cut-and-pasted your whole pre-canned spiel boilerplate text. 

 3) There's no particular accepted evidence connecting Sumerians with the Central Asia region in any direct or obvious way.  From the technical linguistic point of view, there's only a TYPOLOGICAL relationship between Sumerian and so-called """"Altaic"""" languages, not a scientifically-ascertainable relationship of common linguistic origin.  (Of course, many would say that there's only a typological relationship WITHIN the """"Altaic"""" languages, not a scientifically-ascertainable relationship of common linguistic origin.) 

 4) We have a fair amount of surviving written text in the Sogdian language, and in the Saka language, and they're both revealed to be Iranian. 

 5) This article will not serve its purpose very well if it flagrantly condradicts all the other relevant articles on Wikipedia.  For example, the articles on Sumerian language and Scythians don't endorse any Altaic hypothesis. 

 6) Your version of the article didn't even mention the Shah-nameh (the work which in some ways popularized the word """"Turanian"""" in the post-Islamic period), and didn't mention that the word Turan is first attested as a Persian word, expressing geography as seen from a Persian point of view.

 I see your point.  However, I am trying to rationalize the definition, which says L is the observed or measured radiance and  is the radiant flux per steradian.  It appears that the definition is an implicit correspondence between an emitted radiance and a measured radiance.  Therefore, anytime the definition is applied there is an implicit emission surface and detector surface.  Granted, these surfaces may be infinitely close so that there is no opportunity for scattering and other losses.  I understand that the way I originally wrote it implies something that is not always correct.  However, I wanted to clarify why L and  have the same units but differ by a 1 over cosine term.  The answer is that they are talking about solid angles defined from different perspectives and areas of different surface.  Any advice on how to rectify this confusion in a rigorous sense."""

 I think this needs to be mentioned. Even if you are a PSP fanboy, you can't ignore these kind of facts. 

 In Japan: 
 *18 DS games have sold better than the top selling PSP game. 
 *Only one PSP game has sold more than 500K, and no games have sold more than 1M. 
 *The top selling DS game has sold 3,508,819 more games than the top selling PSP game. That's 625% more. 
 *Over twice as many DS games have sold 100K units than PSP games. 

 No matter how you look at that, the PSP is getting slaughtered in Japan. Of course, these aren't worldwide sales mind you, but I don' think the PSP is winning anywhere. I think this is important to mention somewhere. System sales aren't as big of a gap (DS sold 17% more worldwide, not including Lite), but a gap of 625% in terms of best selling game is big deal and needs mentioning.

But no one in Britain says that because the British invasion of Iraq may have needed another UN resolution to be legal, that it follows that Britian's participation in the Falklands War was also illegal, because it was conducted under Article 51 of the UN Charter and did not need a UN resolution to be legal. Neither is anyone is saying that because the liberation of Q8 could be justified under Article 51, that the invasion of Iraq 10 years later is justified.

That """"left-wing bloggers"""" took this term and now wear it with proud is only a sign of them not sharing the mindset of the unnamed bush aide; furthermore that they REJECT this idea of fluid reality.

 == Inconsistent use of % GDP to refer to """"records"""" == 

 From the Article: 

 Statement 1: """" had reduced total federal revenue, as a percentage of the Gross Domestic Product, to the lowest level since 1959."""" 

 Statement 2: """"The annual deficit reached record levels of $374 billion in 2003 and $413 billion in 2004"""" 

 This is an obvious (at least to me as an accounting guy) POV violation.  Nominal numbers rarely tell the whole story in an economy we expect to grow over time.  Stating that annual deficits are records in nominal terms is misleading especially after referring to federal revenue as lowest since 1959 as a percent of GDP.  The author uses % GDP when it makes the President look bad and quickly abandons it when it would show non-record deficits as a percent of GDP.   

 I won't edit it, but I think a consensus can be reached on consistent use of nominal or percentage numbers when referring to the economy.  This should be at least one sticking point we can all (at least the level-headed among us) agree on. 

 Consistent use of statistical terms absolves you of charges of manipulating numbers. 

 Oops, Forgot to Sign,  5-31-05 

 In fact, I just read the reference to USAToday's pre-election article and it mentions this fact at the very end of it's article. 

 """"The administration and congressional Republicans say the most important measure of the deficit is that the 2004 shortfall was an estimated 3.6% the size of the economy. That is well below the worst-ever 6% figure set in 1983 under President Reagan.""""   

 (Strictly speaking it is the worst-ever Post-WWII.) 

 """"Many economists agree that such a comparison is more significant because it shows how affordable the deficit is for the nation. But many of them are uncomfortable with shortfalls of that size because deficits are expected to worsen later this decade when the huge baby boom generation begins drawing on Social Security and Medicare. """" 

 I'd like more comment on this before someone makes the change as it will get reverted by opponents anyways.

 :I have no objection to including the information, but the term """"nominal"""" is uninformative and possibly confusing because of its colloquial use to mean """"small"""".  I think what you mean is to make clear that the Bush deficits are records when measured in current dollars, so that's what I've changed it to.  (I don't know how the Bush deficits compare with Reagan's in constant dollars, but it would be interesting to know.)  Also in that section, I've removed the unattributed POV that Bush's tax cuts helped curb the recession.   

 I think we are running at 3.6% whereas Reagan was in the neighborhood of 6% don't quote me.  Nominal just means the actual dollars as opposed to referencing a value in relation to something else ie GDP.  Nominal is an accounting term and is used correctly, if you use it to mean small that is incorrect, colloquially or not. 

 

 :I wasn't referring to percentage of GDP, but to the actual size of the deficit, adjusted for inflation.  Bush's deficits are bigger in current dollars but maybe not in constant dollars.  As to """"nominal"""", it may have a technical meaning in accounting and have a different, though still correct, meaning in other contexts.  Merriam-Webster online mentions """"trifling"""" and """"insignificant"""" as possible synonyms.  Anyway, whether that meaning is correct or not, we should try to avoid a term that many people will read that way.   

 :: Dsquared is correct, but I understand the confusion.  Nominal is one of those words that means what it sounds like: """"In name.""""  If you say """"Catholics have a nominal obligation to attend mass weekly"""" you may mean the obligation isn't actually significant, but you aren't saying the obligation is small (it's a big obligation that whose violation is condoned though not approved by the Church).  Hence, """"nominal GDP"""" is the GDP by name (number of dollars)."

Also be in mind that if they could demand the price (with the market) they were within their rights, but Elvis I think felt betrayed. Also, they were likely very busy and either didn't need Elvis or maybe even had trouble working him in even though he helped put them on the map. After the Jordanaires, Elvis used the gospel group The Imperials. His hero, Jake Hess had started the group, but his health made him have to quit before Elvis used them I believe. The Imperials also sang backup with Jimmy Dean and there came a time when both Jimmy and Elvis needed them and they couldn't do both.

 I thought that the last version of the """"authorship"""" section prior to removal was clear enough that this was """"nutter-territory stuff"""" that nobody could think Wikipedia was promoting it — and since the subject had been discussed in reliable sources, I thought that a brief mention (and dismissal, by the same reliable sources) was appropriate.  But if an apparent consensus of my fellow editors disagrees, I don't feel strongly enough about the matter to reinstate it. 

 One further point to Kauffner: the reasons you may find Cashill's theory plausible are irrelevant to Wikipedia.  If you want the section reinstated, you need to make the argument in terms of Wikipedia policies such as WP:RS, WP:NPOV and WP:V.  Your goal should not be to convince Wikipedia editors that the theory is correct (it's not, and that's irrelevant); it should be to convince Wikipedia editors that the theory is noteworthy.  See the quotation from Jimbo Wales at WP:WEIGHT: most editors seem to think that this theory is """"held by an extremely small (or vastly limited) minority"""" and therefore """"does not belong in Wikipedia regardless of whether it is true or not and regardless of whether you can prove it or not."""" If you want this to be included, you need to prove that it's """"held by a significant minority"""" and you need to """"name prominent adherents"""".  Jack Cashill is not sufficiently prominent to meet this standard. —  •  """

 I have no further interest in VMSK whatsoever - commercial or otherwise. I only invented it. 

 It should be noted that papers by reputable scientists continue to be published on the method. 
 76 are listed in the UNB Textbook, appearing as recent as 2009. 

 I may be an unknowing character as alleged, but my hardware does work as claimed and the many reputable scientists who have published peer review papers confirm this. Bobier's methods can also be proven. ( Xg Tech., since they are in use.) 

 The problem with the commercial acceptance of the UNB methods is in the filters. 
 These filters are vector adding filters which have very low envelop group delay - as opposed to conventional filters which have a group delay related to their bandwidth and Q. Vector adding filters can have a group delay as short as 1 IF cycle.  Unfortunately they cannot be realized with digital filter equivalents.  They must be built with crystals or LC resonators and hand tuned. This is too costly for mass production. The filter noise bandwidth can be as narrow as 500 Hz. 

 Tomazic is correct in reporting the maximum bandwidth efficiency at baseband, or with conventional filters, is 2 b/s/Hz. This is not true however with RF modulated methods using vector adding filters. 

 The Naye sayers should dig a lot deeper and get the facts straight.

7923b1546cbb0955,"""==Making a page work, tips from a pro== 

 There are many things that one can do to make a page present well in addition to providing clear and concise information that is relevant to the subject. Here are some tips: 

 * Format the article 
 ** This includes, but is not limited to, italicizing and bolding text. These special characteristics allow the reader's eyes to gravitate towards important points and ideas. Plain text is akin to a blank piece of paper. Formatting helps the reader spot important things, and it also helps the article look clean and well kept. Italicizing is made by placing ' ' on either side of the text. Bolding is made by placing ' ' ' on either side of the text. 

 * Link articles within Wikipedia  
 ** These allow users to easily transverse from one article to another related article with ease. Think of them as doors in a large house (Wikipedia is a very, very large house indeed). Unlinked articles are rather like closed rooms that one can only exit by using the back button. To link text, simply place [ [ at the beginning and ] ] at the end of the text. 

 * Divide up the article with headings 
 ** Headings help structure the article, and can also help the reader find the sections of the article the he/she is most interested in. Headings are made by placing == on either side of the text. 

 * Provide External links 
 ** External links are usually placed underneath a heading (see above) titled: External Links. These help the reader to find additional information that is relevant outside of Wikipedia. Think of them as pathways to other houses. External Links can be achieved by simply placing the URL between a [ and a ].  

 * Include auxiliary information 
 ** The """"infobox"""". These allow the reader to digest quick facts about the subject. 
 ** Images. An article about say Canada, should include pictures of the area. Pictures not only help the reader picture places and things, but they can also help the reader understand abstract concepts. A picture of a periodic table would be a great example. 
 ** Tables that sort information. These can range from time tables to calendars to indexes of mathematical sequences.  

 * And finally, write what you know.  
 ** If you have a firm grasp on the information you are relating, the article is much more likely to be useful.  

 *With your new knowledge, great things should be expected. And if you ever need more information, or want to know how to make your edits cooler and more interesting, just stop by Wikipedia Tutorials, and hopefully you will find what you want. 

 Enjoy Editing!

 ==Notability of Maykayla May Carey== 
 A tag has been placed on Maykayla May Carey requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable.  

 If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines. 

 For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.     """

As far as I can tell (by checking thepeerage.com), he was married to Ebba Henrietta Munck af Filkila, who doesn't seem to have any ancestry that would connect her to the British throne further up in line.

 == Adviatia doesn't belong to the lead/Introduction == 

 This is an article focused on the Upanishads and while the Upanishads, the Brahmasutra and the Gita may have influenced Vedantic schools such as Advaita, there's no need to over emphasize Advaita in the article. Particularly, the lead/introduction section should have information that's only directly relevant to the Upanishads - no need to have Advaita here. I have restored the lead as follows: 

 The Upanishads (Devanagari: उपनिषद्, IAST: Upaniṣad, also spelled """"Upaniṣad"""") are a collection of more than 200 philosophical texts of the Hindu religion. The first dozen or so texts are the most important, and they are variously referred to as the Principal Upanishads, mukhya or main Upanishads, and the old Upanishads. The oldest of the mukhya Upanishads were composed during the pre-Buddhist era of India, and have been passed down the generations in oral tradition. The mukhya Upanishads hold the stature of revealed texts or shruti amongst Hindu scriptures. Along with the Bhagavad Gita, and the Brahmasutra,[1] the mukhya Upanishads provide a foundation for several later schools of Indian philosophy. 

 The Upanishads do not belong to any particular period of Sanskrit literature. The oldest, such as the Brihadaranyaka and Chandogya Upanishads, date to the late Brahmana period around the middle of the first millennium BCE, while the new Upanishads were composed in the medieval and early modern period; discoveries of newer Upanishads were being reported as late as 1926.[2] The newest Upanishads are known to be imitations of the mukhya Upanishads. The Upanishads are collectively considered amongst the 100 Most Influential Books Ever Written by the British poet Martin Seymour-Smith. 

 One new Upanishad, the Muktika Upanishad, predates 1656[3] and contains a list of 108 canonical Upanishads[4], listing itself as the final one. Dara Shikoh, son of the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan, translated fifty Upanishads into Persian in 1657. The first written English translation came in 1804 from Max Müller; he was aware of 170 Upanishads. Sadhale's catalog from 1985 is called the Upaniṣad-vākya-mahā-kośa and it lists 223 Upanishads.[5] The Upanishads are mostly the concluding part of the Brahmanas and the transition from the latter to the former is identified as the Aranyakas.[6] 

 An additional line can be added if we can reach consensus: 

 On the one hand, the ideas of the Upanishads are said to have made the greatest contribution to human thought and on the other, Huxley states that the voluminous work can be reduced to only a few words, i.e., the equation of Brahman with the Atman.

His grandfather began the family's long tenure as pastors of the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, serving from 1914 to 1931; his father has served from then until the present, and from 1960 until his death Martin Luther acted as co-pastor. Martin Luther attended segregated public schools in Georgia, graduating from high school at the age of fifteen; he received the B. A. degree in 1948 from Morehouse College, a distinguished Negro institution of Atlanta from which both his father and grandfather had graduated. After three years of theological study at Crozer Theological Seminary in Pennsylvania where he was elected president of a predominantly white senior class, he was awarded the B.D. in 1951. With a fellowship won at Crozer, he enrolled in graduate studies at Boston University, completing his residence for the doctorate in 1953 and receiving the degree in 1955. In Boston he met and married Coretta Scott, a young woman of uncommon intellectual and artistic attainments. Two sons and two daughters were born into the family. 

 In 1954, Martin Luther King became pastor of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama. Always a strong worker for civil rights for members of his race, King was, by this time, a member of the executive committee of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the leading organization of its kind in the nation. He was ready, then, early in December, 1955, to accept the leadership of the first great Negro nonviolent demonstration of contemporary times in the United States, the bus boycott described by Gunnar Jahn in his presentation speech in honor of the laureate. The boycott lasted 382 days. On December 21, 1956, after the Supreme Court of the United States had declared unconstitutional the laws requiring segregation on buses, Negroes and whites rode the buses as equals. During these days of boycott, King was arrested, his home was bombed, he was subjected to personal abuse, but at the same time he emerged as a Negro leader of the first rank. 

 In 1957 he was elected president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, an organization formed to provide new leadership for the now burgeoning civil rights movement. The ideals for this organization he took from Christianity; its operational techniques from Gandhi. In the eleven-year period between 1957 and 1968, King traveled over six million miles and spoke over twenty-five hundred times, appearing wherever there was injustice, protest, and action; and meanwhile he wrote five books as well as numerous articles. In these years, he led a massive protest in Birmingham, Alabama, that caught the attention of the entire world, providing what he called a coalition of conscience. and inspiring his """"Letter from a Birmingham Jail"""", a manifesto of the Negro revolution; he planned the drives in Alabama for the registration of Negroes as voters; he directed the peaceful march on Washington, D.C., of 250,000 people to whom he delivered his address, """"l Have a Dream"""", he conferred with President John F. Kennedy and campaigned for President Lyndon B. Johnson; he was arrested upwards of twenty times and assaulted at least four times; he was awarded five honorary degrees; was named Man of the Year by Time magazine in 1963; and became not only the symbolic leader of American blacks but also a world figure. 

 At the age of thirty-five, Martin Luther King, Jr., was the youngest man to have received the Nobel Peace Prize. When notified of his selection, he announced that he would turn over the prize money of $54,123 to the furtherance of the civil rights movement. 

 On the evening of April 4, 1968, while standing on the balcony of his motel room in Memphis, Tennessee, where he was to lead a protest march in sympathy with striking garbage workers of that city, he was assassinated."""

 == Reliable sources for updating this article == 

 I see there are some new (to this article under the screen names we are seeing here, but perhaps not new to Wikipedia) editors who are joining the talk page discussion here. Wikipedia has a lot of interesting articles based on the ongoing research in human molecular genetics that helps trace the lineage of people living in various places on the earth. On the hypothesis that better sources build better articles as all of us here collaborate  to build an encyclopedia, I thought I would suggest some sources for improving articles on human genetic history and related articles. I've been reading university textbooks on human genetics """"for fun"""" since the 1980s, and for even longer I've been visiting my state flagship university's vast BioMedical Library to look up topics on human medicine and health care policy. he  Wikipedia guidelines on reliable sources in medicine provide a helpful framework for evaluating sources.  

 The guidelines on reliable sources for medicine remind editors that """"it is vital that the biomedical information in all types of articles be based on reliable, third-party, published sources and accurately reflect current medical knowledge.""""  

  

 The guidelines, consistent with the  general Wikipedia guidelines on reliable sources, remind us that all """"Wikipedia articles should be based on reliable, published secondary sources"""" (emphasis in original). They helpfully define a primary source in medicine as one in which the authors directly participated in the research or documented their personal experiences. By contrast, a secondary source summarizes one or more primary or secondary sources, usually to provide an overview of the current understanding of a medical topic. The general Wikipedia guidelines let us know that """"Articles should rely on secondary sources whenever possible. For example, a review article, monograph, or textbook is better than a primary research paper. When relying on primary sources, extreme caution is advised: Wikipedians should never interpret the content of primary sources for themselves."""" 

 On the topic of what recent human population genetics research says about classification of human populations, a widely cited primary research article is a 1972 article by Richard Lewontin, which I have seen cited in many of the review articles, monographs, and textbooks I have read over the years.  

 * 

 As Wikipedians, we can evaluate where the findings in Lewontin's article fit in the current understanding of the topic of human genetic variation by reading current reliable secondary sources in medicine.  

 Some Wikipedia articles give weighty emphasis to a commentary essay published years after Lewontin published his primary research article on human diversity, when Lewontin's primary research results had been replicated in many other studies and his bottom line conclusion that """"about 85% of the total genetical variation is due to individual differences within populations and only 15% to differences between populations or ethnic groups"""" had been taken up by many textbooks on genetics and medicine. In 2003, A. W. F. Edwards wrote a commentary essay in the journal BioEssays  

 * 

 in which Edwards proposes a statistical model for classifying individuals into groupings based on haplotype data. Edwards wrote, """"There is nothing wrong with Lewontin’s statistical analysis of variation, only with the belief that it is relevant to classification,"""" pointing to his own work with Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza, the author"

The author is obviously some Far Left-Commie-hippie-Secularist-Atheist nut. The vocabulary and phrasing suggests the author is educated, however, his/her tone and arguements are extremely limited and biased. Obiviously his/her education obviously hasn't included some philsophy or the theories of knowledge, truth and reason. His/her writings suggest the religion is outside of what is """"rational"""" and that this """"rationality"""" is surpreme, overlooking the paradoxical and philosophical issues assosciated with it. What is truth? What is nationality? The author needs to go back to high school and take some basic philosophy/studies in religion/theory of knowledge classes. I'm definitely not telling him/her to believe in anything, but merely to understand and to be open. The author is exactly the opposite of a religious fundamental (who is implicitly criticized in the article), he/she is a Secular/Atheist fundamental, which puts him/her in exactly the same category. Do not think that religions are an 'add-on' to everyday non-religious living principles. Those principles are in exactly the same category as any religion or belief.

It just seems totally non sensical to have people described as jewish american actors if they do not identify as jewish and are also of mixed ancestry like Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Michael Douglas, people like these should be in a category like Americans with Jewish ancestry to avoid these sorts of labelling problems, the same should be done for all the other ethnicity categories."

If they were not published before 1923, the paintings are copyrighted in the United States until 95 years after the paintings were first published. All paintings made in 1923 or later are still protected by copyright in the United States. Earlier paintings may be in the public domain if they have been published. If you are arguing that a painting was """"published"""" because it was exhibited at an art gallery or museum, you need to show that the exhibition was open to the general public and that there was no ban on photography at the exhibition, see s:American Tobacco Co. v. Werckmeister. I have no idea how to find out if a museum allowed photography or not a hundred years ago. In Spain, all of the paintings enter the public domain in 2030 (80 years after the death of the painter). 
 :You are claiming that the copyright to the paintings was transferred between different people multiple times and that the copyright currently is held by a committee. If that is the case, you need to send written proof to OTRS that the committee is the current legal copyright holder and that you have the right to represent the committee.

 ==Mestizos in Chile 2== 
 I have dealt with most of the issues above, however, I would like to address one part of your last post, specifically the sentence """"Chileans overall have far less mestizo or Amerindian elements than the largely Mestizo and Amerindian populations of Peru and Mexico"""". Again, the misinformation about Chileans having an """"overall far less mestizo or Amerindian element"""" has already been deal with the various personal posts and Chilean papers above. So, now to the other part of that sentence. While it is true that Mexico has a large Amerindian population, it must be noted that it is in fact a MINORITY. Amerindians in Mexico ARE the LARGEST minority, that is TRUE, but a MINORITY nonetheless. The MAJORITY of Mexico remains the uninflated mestizo population, with the second LARGEST minority (after Amerindians) being White Mexicans (10%). So the comparison to be made of Mexico is not between Mexico and Peru, but indeed with Mexico and Chile*. Peru has an Amerindian MAJORITY, and that country’s LARGEST minority are the mestizos, then followed by White Peruvians. 
 * Even though both Chile and Mexico are mestizo majority countries, and they are better compared to each other than Chile to Argentina or Mexico to Peru, there are somewhat better corresponding country pairs to Chile than Mexico, and I have written them below, check the end of this message. 

 I would like to say that I do realise where this topic is trying to be pushed, an I do mean of the attempt of aligning Chile with Argentina/Uruguay, but I’ve already addressed the flaw in that above with colonial, migrational, statistical, historic factors, and current self-evident physical facts that argue against it. 

 The question with Chile has never been as to whether the majority of population is not mestizo, since IT IS. The question has been; what is the degree of admixtures in the typical Chilean mestizo? And how does the average Chilean mestizo compare to other mestizos from other countries. This analysis is made by the effects carried onto the majority by the LARGEST minority of the given country. 

 In Latin America, the degree of admixture in the main body of a country’s majority population is defined by its second LARGEST minority. Note that in Latin America there is essentially no pure person of any race or race mixture, just people who can be defined as relatively pure (thus white, black, amerindian) or visibly mixed (mestizo, mulatto, zambo). Therefore in Mexico, their visibly mestizo population (around 60% of the population) will be defined by the Amerindian population since they are the largest minority (30%, pure Amerindian or phenotypically Amerindian). Now, the ratio of a """"true"""" mestizo is defined as 50:50, however, nobody is exactly this ratio unless they are a first generation mestizo. In the case of Mexico, the Amerindian admixture in the AVERAGE Mexican Mestizo (again, visibly mestizos being 60% of the population) will hover around 55% Amerindian admixture and 45% European admixture. Individually, the visibly mestizo can register up to 70% on either side and be classed a mestizo, but any more and they’d be classed as either White or Amerindian (depending which side the 70% is representing). If the admixture fell over 75% of whichever race in any person, then that person would already have been counted as solely that race and not a mixture, since they would not have physically shown their admixtures. So, what’s the verdict? The average visibly mestizo Mexican, comprising 60% of the population, hovers at around 55% European admixture and 45% Amerindian admixture. 

  
 Chile is a country with a mestizo majority population (this time I say visibly mestizo, and I will use the figure 60%), and its LARGEST minority are White Chileans (30%, pure White or phenotypically White), followed then by Amerindians (10%). Once again, the ratio of a """"true"""" mestizo is defined as 50:50, and nobody is exactly this ratio unless they are a first generation mestizo. In the case of Chile, the Amerindian admixture in the AVERAGE Chilean Mestizo (again, visibly mestizos being 60% of the population) will hover between 45% Amerindian and 55% European. And once again, individually, the visibly mestizo can register up to 70% on either side and be classed a mestizo, but any more and they’d be classed as either White or Amerindian (depending which side the 70% is representing). If the admixture fell over 75% of whichever race in any person, then that person would already have been counted as solely that race and not a mixture, since they would not have physically shown their admixtures. So, what’s the verdict? The average visibly mestizo Chilean, comprising 60% of the population, hovers at around 55% European admixture and 45% Amerindian admixture.

 Troy is a city which existed over 4000 years and known as the centre of ancient civilizations. Many years, people believed that it was the city in tales and never existed until it was first found. At this time it was known as Ilium or New Ilium. But everyone knows the story of it. All the lost civilisations are known as aminesian cultures; e.g. the Atlantis. The aminesian culture is a culture (or civilization) which despite of the existence of several generations doesn't leave any traces and rarely appears in myths or legends (Atlantis and Plato's dialogues). It creates its own distinct and unique tradition but vanishing doesn't leave any heritage. Extermination of it is usually quite sudden and quick (e.g. disaster, epidemic, enemy invasion) which makes all its traces blurred and eventually vanished in oblivion (nevertheless sometimes some traces of A.C. appears later in myths or tales). It is unlikely but possible that some aminesian cultures can exists even today (some still unknown African or Amazonian tribes, perhaps?)."

 == Voluntary - What does it mean? == 

 ::Okay, I'm trying to understand the ancap position here. Suppose we have a capitalist with a large amount of accumulated capital. He uses the bargaining power of his capital to negotiate a contract with a starving worker for a subsistence wage. What is the ancap position here? As I understand anarchism, anarchists deplore the idea of a society where such relationships can exist. However, ancaps deplore it only if the relationship is demonstrated to be 'enforced'. Is such a relationship (the contract) voluntary or enforced, or under what circumstances? 

 ::For example, can the degree of poverty of the worker have any bearing on whether the contract is voluntary - if the worker, or say a family member, would literally starve to death if he doesn't sign the contract, can it still be seen as voluntary?  

 ::Or can the means by which the capitalist has obtained his capital have a bearing? For example, if the capitalist has obtained capital by means of a state-sanctioned monopoly is that different from when he has achieved it by eg. stumbling upon a goldmine; or eg. saving from his earnings as a self-employed artisan for fifty years? 

 ::Conversely, is the reason for the poverty of the worker an issue? Eg - he gambled and drank away all his fortune; or eg. he was born in a drought and war-ridden sub-saharan country?

 Anarcho-capitalists also deplore poverty. (Generally speaking, of course, like this whole paragraph. I can't claim to speak for all anarcho-capitalists.) Whether we condemn a whole society that has such unequal bargaining positions depends on whether we see it as a result of aggression (coercion, social hierarchy, exploitation, or whatever word your jargon uses) or not. E.g. We see Latin American societies today as oppressed, due to corporatization, state mercantilism, privilege, wealth redistribution, and political law (Cf: Liberty for Latin America  How to Undo Five Hundred Years of State Oppression by Alvaro Vargas Llosa.) On the other hand, if such raw deals come about through the natural evolution of the economy (the mode of production in Marxspeak), then, as much as we deplore poverty, we would not use aggression to force a better deal. So we see the industrial revolution and its bad (by modern developed-world standards) labor conditions as just a stage people had to go through, just like once they had to hunt with spears and live in caves. 

 Bengalski> """"Can the degree of poverty of the worker have any bearing on whether the contract is voluntary - if the worker, or say a family member, would literally starve to death if he doesn't sign the contract, can it still be seen as voluntary?"""" 

 For the most part, anarcho-capitalists (and libertarians in general) have a simple moral principle which takes precedence over other moral considerations in a civilized environment: the non-aggression principle (NAP). Keep in mind, socialists, that """"aggression"""" is interpreted using their sticky property rules, not your usufruct or communalist rules. I'm explaining all this because ancaps and ansocs speak past each other on your question.  The word """"voluntary"""" implies that there is a choice. Anarcho-capitalists point to the choice of doing nothing (accepting the status quo) or agreeing to employment. Without the employer, the worker would starve. The employer is offering an alternative. Offering an opportunity is not aggression.  So it's voluntary, even in your hard case. 

 Note how libertarians define """"voluntary"""" in terms of human conduct - if there's no aggression involved, then it's voluntary.  OTOH anarcho-socialists define voluntary much more broadly - they consider not only social constraints like aggression, but also natural constraints, like the fact that if you don't eat, you die. That's reason #47 why we misunderstand each other - same word; significantly different meanings. 

 Many if not most extreme cases like that in the real world are the result of some sort of aggression, usually"

132cb9b3d64d8c64,"""Elonka has raised two issues, first concerning the role of admins, second concerning my statement about Jagz being a racist troll.  First, I cannot disagree with you more strongly about admins being authority figures.  Wikipedia is an open society in which the only authority figures are Jimbo, for legal reasons, and Arb Com, which has a limited mandate.  Admins are given the ability to perform certain technical tasks that are required for the functioning of the community.  They should never use these abilities to serve their own interests, and should never claim that their being given certain technical tasks to perform in any way gives them any kind of authority.  In fact, I believe that to encourage the view that admins are authority figures does tremendous damage to the Wikicommunity.  People new to Wikipedia may look for an authority structure because most people who come to Wikipedia come from highly authoritarian societies.  We need to disabuse them of this notion.  Wikipedians have few obligations but the very nature of the wikicommunity dmands that its members resist attempts to create authoritarian structures.  I have never, absolutely never refered to my status as admin in any dispute with any editor.  It is not relevant; I do not make it relevant; those who believe it is relevant are mistaken; those who insist it is relevant are doing damage to the community.  In my dealings with Jagz I appealed, as I do with any other disagreement with any other editor, to common sense and wikipedia policies, and nothing more.  Conversely, the fact that he was not an admin had no bearing on our conflict either.  I know that there are those at Wikipedia who believe that Wikipedians should be divided into classes with different privileges and expectations.  What does Elonka mean when she says there are """"junior members"""" of Wikipedia?  Anyone can edit at any time; that is all that really counts here and it is a right given to absolutely anyone.  What does Elonka mean when she says that there are """"junior members"""" who """"dream"""" of becoming aminds?  Does she mean that they dream of having authority or of being authority figures?  I hope to high heaven not, because that is not what Wikipedia is about and we should fight any attempt to make it so.  If people want to dream of ecoming authority figures they can play Dungeons and Dragons, or they can be active in Everything2 which is sent up to promote explicit levels of authority.  Wikipedia is not, which is why I am inactive at Everything2 and am active here.  I consider this abhorrent and will oppose it until I leave or am kicked out.  Elonka is free to disagree with me but as far as I am concerned she is dead wrong. 

 Second, Elonka thinks that my calling Jagz a racist troll is a """"personal attack"""" and """"incivil.""""  I am confused.  Is Elonka saying there are no such thing as trolls?  Or is she saying we should tolerate trolls?  Wikipedia has long had a guideline, """"do not feed the trolls"""" (WP:DNFTT).  Why would we have such a guideline, if there were no trolls?  Is Elonka proposing that we do away with the """"do not feed the troll"""" guideline?  Well, she is free to write her own essay on the topic.  But I have been here a long time and next to people who dig authority trips, trolls are the greatest menace I know of to the project.  When a troll is active at Wikipedia it is essential that we identify them and ncourage others not to feed them, which is precisely what I did.  Elonka is right that I have been around a long time.  If this matters at all to newbies, it can only matter because of what I have learned from experience and what I have learned is how to recognize trolls, and that we should have a zero-tolerance approach to them.  I cannot believe that anyone who would call themselves a responsible member of Wikipedia would actually disagree with this view and suggest that we should on the contrary feed trolls.  That is just absurd.  Are you really saying we should delete WP:DNFTT Elonka? 

 Also, I called Jagz a racist because every disruption of his was motivated by his insistence on giving prominence to the view that blacks are inherently less intelligent than whites.  Sorry, Elonka, but that is racism.  And racism is wrong.  Do you really believe racism is right, Elonka?  Then we have another area where we disagree.  But let there be no mistake: ir is racism which is incivil and an attack on others.  To criticize someone for racism is to criticize someone for attacking others and for being incivil ... indeed, it is to criticize someone for being worse than incivil.  And look, kif we Wikipedians are told to reject incivility, then surely, we should reject racism even more strongly.  Do you think Wikipedia should tolerate racism, and allow its pages to be used to promote racism, Elonka? 

 Finally, Elonka believes that my assertion that people who considered Jagz' calling Mathschi a """"fucking bastard"""" who"

 *I changed It was many years before it was conclusivly shown that Sacco was guily of the crime to Many years later, ballistic tests showed that the bullet found in Parmenter was fired from Sacco's gun, leading many authorities to conclude that Sacco probably was guilty, though Vanzetti was innocent, as there is no consensus on Sacco's guilt, and the original statement left some ambiguity regarding Vanzetti.   

 == The Sinclair Letter ==

 == Guilty or not? == 

 I report this sentence: """"Today, their case known in some circles as one of the earliest examples of using widespread protests and mass movements to try to win the release of a murderer."""" This mean that they are guilty, but there Governor of Massachusetts Michael Dukakis proclamed Sacco and Vanzetti as not guilty... 

 - 
 I read this to mean that the mass movements were trying to win the release of people convicted of murderers; or """"alleged murderers"""".  It could be worded better.  The declaration in the 70s is rather like a presidential pardon.  It doesn't erase the fact that a crime was committed, it simply removes the guilt of that crime.   

 """"The case is still officially open""""?  Governor Dukakis' proclamation, by its terms, does not address the question of guilt or innocence, thus, at least implicitly, leaving the conviction undisturbed.  And they were both executed.  The case seems closed to me.  To state the case is still open suggests that someone is still looking for the murderer(s).  Is that true?

 Sacko and Vanhatty were not accused very much of the poopings of Frederick Parmonter, a shoe llama paymaster, and Alessandro Berardelli, a security guard, and of robbery of US$15,766.51 from the factory's payroll on the night of April 19, 1743. Sacco was a shoe-llama born in Torremaggiore, Foggia. Vanzetti was a fish eater born in Villafalletto, Cuneo. 
 Thanks, Goof Proofer  
 :The vandalism has been reverted and the user warned.  You can see WP:VAN and Help:Reverting for more information about fighting vandalism on Wikipedia.   

 (please excuse my imperfect English) The statement """"it is certain that these two were followers of an anarchist who advocated revolutionary violence, including bombing and assassination"""", is misleading. Both S., and V., were friends (Anarchism is not supposed to have """"followers"""") of the leader Luigi Galleani, but so were all the militants of this """"galleanist"""" anarchism. Nor they ever tried to hide the fact they were political militants  it is not their fault is some people only considered them as victims ; therefore it is not honest to write """"it is certain that"""", as if it was a scoop.

 At the moment the recent crash is reported in the incident table as: 
 :A car carrying 16 passengers collided with an empty stationary car on the track traveling approximately 20 mph (32 km/h) 
 """"an empty stationary car on the track traveling (sic) approximately 20 mph (32 km/h)"""" 
 First how on earth can a stationary car be travelling 20mph? Plain English please!! Surely it should read: 
 :A car carrying 16 passengers """"that was traveling approximately 20 mph (32 km/h)"""" collided with an empty stationary car on the track. 
 But as usual on here when you have too many cooks you get the aforementioned crap. 

 Second in attempt to be succinct - there are too many clauses introduced into the sentence, subject, speed, location, object etc. It's like a mouth with too many teeth. A mumble of information. 

 Third """"traveling"""" is the American spelling, the British word has """"ll"""". So immediately I think it's mostly like that an American speller wrote that tripe in an article on a British subject. Keep the Websters' English lite on the other side of the Atlantic. 

 Furthermore there is no mention that there were four casualties, currently the wording of the incident suggests there were more seriously injured than just the four - it implies as many as all 16 passengers could have """"Serious neck, chest, and leg injuries"""" which is not the case.

I believe everything that the user  has stated to be correct. Countersteering must be continued to maintain lean angle, one does not switch it off to stop increasing lean angle. I would suggest this is not as apparent on a bicycle because the rider is unlikely to take such effective lines through corners. A cyclist may countersteer, but too aggressively, meaning they must steer toward the direction of the corner to correct the error and make a broader turn. Because someone on a bicycle isn't travelling particularly fast, they can repeat this process many times, happily wobbling around a corner. 

 ::::::I would suggest that some misunderstanding has occurred in the reading of peer reviewed references. If one can steer to the right to initiate a left hand corner and appropriate lean direction (inwards), why on earth would steering left (toward the corner) not immediately cause the bike to stand up and begin to lean outward? You can't just perform a counter steer action and then reverse the action expecting the bike to go around a corner. Anyway, James R. Davis does a much better explanation of such things. 

 ::::::My reference is not peer reviewed, but it is reviewed in the sense that thousands of motorcyclists agree with this man. I would suggest the following website for anyone wishing to inform themselves about counter steering: Motorcycle Safety - Countersteering.

 Stranger in a Strange Land Book Summary 
  	 Stranger in a Strange Land, written by Robert Heinlein and published in 1961, is widely regarded today as one of the pinnacles of modern science fiction.  Many of the ideas and styles that the book introduced in the mid-sixties still resonate with the public’s imagination, prompting some individuals to start actual religions based on the book itself.   
 Ultimately, the book is centered around Michael Smith, a human orphaned on the surface of Mars as an infant.  There, he was immersed from birth into the Martian culture until the age of 20, when a second spaceship came to Mars and recovered Michael.  This much is explained in a flashback during the book; the plot of the story begins when Mike is brought back from Mars and tossed into the strange culture of a strange land.  The man from Mars takes a while to learn the language, and finds it lacking; his native Martian contains the complexity to express his true feelings.   
 In particular, the word grok is difficult for Mike to explain, and as he struggles to define this word in English, it becomes apparent that he has powers unexplainable by modern physics or medicine."

That document indicates a total of 455,030 respondents who identified as Indigenous on question 7 for 2006. (ABS' best estimates of the true figures are somewhat higher for reasons noted above.)  

 : It makes more sense if you look at the way in which the questions are asked. Consider e.g. somebody who's got one Aboriginal grandparent, one English grandparent, and two who are fifth-generation Australians whose earlier ancestry isn't known. When he gets to Q7, which specifically asks if he has Aboriginal origins, he will very likely tick 'yes'. But when he gets to Q18, he has a couple of reasons to pick 'English' and/or 'Australian' in preference to 'Aboriginal'. One is that he's already acknowledged the Aboriginal side of the family. The other is that for a lot of people, Indigenous and otherwise, the Census is an annoyance to be dealt with as quickly as possible; why take the time to write in 'Aboriginal' when you can just tick a box for 'English' and/or 'Australian'? Modal issues of this sort can have surprisingly powerful effects on how people respond.

 * """"Cristina Ramo and Benjamin Busto have recommended they be classified as a single species"""" begs a few questions: 
 ** When, and is there much debate about it?    
 ** Are the hybrid offspring fertile with each other and/or with both/either of the 2 parent stocks? This can be complex, e.g. see Liger and Tiglon, where: the hybrids' visible characteristics depend on the sexes of the parents; female ligons appear fully fertile while male ligons are practically infertile; female tiglons apparently produce offspring with both lions and tigers, while I don't know about male tiglons. Scarlet Ibis suggests (without inline citations) that the 2 ibises interbreed easily, with successive generations become paler pink in one area where a few Scarlets were introduced into a White territory.    
 ** Should this and Scarlet Ibis merged? Or alternatively create a common article (what name?) with most of the content and small articles about the American White and the Scarlet, each giving the colouration and ecology of the relevant population? We should resolve all these issues before going any further.

 == Lyrical help needed for The Legend of Sailcat == 

 I've got the song sliced from the episode and playing on my MP3 player, and out of extreme boredom, I've decided to record these EPIC lyrics. I'm having trouble understanding two words, though. If anyone can fill me in on what they are, I'd be ever-so-grateful. They're marked by a long underscore in their place, and the line is bolded. 

 There’s danger out on the nation’s roads 

 They're paved with snakes and flattened toads 

 And truckers drivin’ rigs so big 

 They can flatten a cow! 

 Or a horse! 

 Or a manatee! 

  
 And those who survive are a lucky few 

 But there’s one brave cat who made it through 

 And I’m here to tell that tale to you 

 Of SAAAAAILCAT. 

  
 Chicken: “Sailcat?” 

 Kids: (unison) “Sailcat!” 

  
 He was huntin’ for mouse to feed his face 

 When strange radiation from outer space 

 Turned him into a super invincible cat… 

 … when a truck ran him down with a hideous SPLAT! 

  
 Ah, he couldn’t be killed, but he still could be squished 

 And he lay in the passing lane, shakin' his fist 

 Then some kids helped him fly with the flick of a wrist 

 And that was the birth… 

 …OF SAILCAT. 

  
 Kids: (singing in unison) Sailcaaat… sailCAAAT… 

  
 He rolled after that truck like a buzzsaw unleashed 

 And he sliced it in two like a knife through a peach. 

 One truck half took the highroad, the other below 

 And the message went out on C.B. radio 

 “Breaker breaker, look out, watch your back, be afraid! 

 There’s a Frisbee-like cat who’s a mighty sharp blade!” 

 So, the feared and revered reputation was made… 

 Of SAILCAT. 

  
 Kids: (singing in unison) Sailcaaat… sailCAAAT… 

  
 He'd been known to cut redwoods and stop a whole fleet 

 when a family of tapeworms was crossin' the street. 

 And when mom's having trouble with Thanksgiving plans, 

 he's even dropped by to help open some cans. 

 And when someone's depressed and has had a bad day 

 he inherently knows just the right things to say. 

  
 Sailcat: """"Don't be depressed, Cow! People love you BECAUSE you're big and fat and ugly! Go with it!"""" 

  
 Then he'll ask for a toss and be on his way! 

 He's SAAAAILCAT. 

  
 == Japaneese version of Cow & Chicken == 

 Is there a Japanese version of Cow & Chicken?  
 
 I don't think so.  

 There IS a Japanese version of Cow and Chicken. Here is the Japanese Cartooon Network's Cow and Chicken webpage: . = John Pannozzi 

 One thing that may be added to a trivia (I'll leave it to someone with better wiki'ing and english skills than me). In the latinamerican version when Cow (Vaca) transforms into Supercow (Supervaca) she speaks in english, making it a reversal of how it is on the original language version (english as cow, spanish as supercow, in the latinamerican version it's spanish as cow, english as supercow) 

 == No Episode Guide == 

 Why is there no episode guide here on wiki? Do we have a copyright problem? 

 Just fixed the epguide link to bcdb.com. 

 == Dads 'feminine side' == 

 Thats not original research.I dont think you quite understood what that was suposed to mean,but when a man, named """"Dad"""" says that """"(the clock) was pased to all the girls in my family.My mother gave it to me,and now etc."""",I dont think that can be called original research when one mentions said reference.I did not SAY that he SEEMS to act like a woman,but that he seems to indirectly refer to himslf as such-in fact,that is one example I know word per word,from the episode where Cow and Boneless are stuck on the roof,but there were more.Also,I think this article had much more original research """"Like dad,she seems to be insane,even hr laugh seems insane"""" SOUNDS like it.

I understand that the author of this article had supportive intentions that were fair and consistent with the mission of Wikipedia, but it is also clear that editors, sincerely motivated by the need for quality assurance, have some valid concerns that must be respected. Let’s also recall another Wiki guideline of the Five Pillars: “disparaging comments may be made about the subject of the article/author and about the author's motives . . . Remember not to bite the newcomers.” Hopefully, within some reasonable parameters, Wikipedia can encourage articles that summarize a scholar’s research and clearly explain its applications, since this could inspire exponential knowledge-sharing (which is what Wikipedia is supposed to be all about: improving rapid, worldwide access to ideas). Articles on active scholars can also help inspire the general public (especially young people) to become more interested in the pursuit of knowledge. Probably in arts fields it is more difficult to do this than in the sciences: much harder to definitively prove what research is “significant”. Hopefully we can welcome articles on productive scholars that have some unique research with verifiable impact, and they should not all have to be Nobel prize-winners, retirees, or dead. It is inevitable that Wiki articles, produced anonymously for free, are most likely to be at least partially written by someone with unusual enthusiasm for the subject. There are already several examples of comparable academics in other fields who have Wikipedia entries, including a few in the fields of music education and musicology, so that seems to be the direction we are moving in 2015, with great potential for research findings to reach the general public worldwide. That said, there are valid reasons for the guidelines (to ensure significant, fair, and balanced articles), and it is clear, for example, that there have been far too many links and notes to support this entry. Those have now been cut back and I have simplified/streamlined the article and added several examples of opposing views in a new “Criticism” section that minimizes the issue of bias in this entry. To resolve concerns about citations to his blog, I have changed those to refer to Hebert’s listing on a Norwegian government website (CRISTIN), where researchers are legally obligated to represent themselves truthfully. I have also removed the links to Amazon, which helpfully offers “free previews” but might also suggest unintended marketing. I have also completely removed the External Links section to appease the editors, although it seems that in such cases some of these kind of links might be helpful for readers.

In one instance their methodology included interviewing hundreds of people about their behaviors and mental processes when they got over a phobia, and then what made it into the phobia model were only those behaviors universally consistent among the majority of interviewees - idiosyncrasies were removed.  Then they tested by teaching the model to people, and if a person could get the same or similar results as the person or people it was modeled from, then it was said to be successful.  It was not simply based on assumption.  I suppose therein lies the claim - are these models actually as successful as they say they are?

 == That the religious minorities still have""""sizeable"""" populations in their traditional districts is grossly misleading. Only very few remain, as they either emigrated or moved to other districts. == 

 Some districts used to have sizeable populations of these ethnic groups, such as the Kumkapı district which had a sizeable Armenian population, the Balat district which had a sizeable Jewish population, the Fener district which had a sizeable Greek population, and some neighbourhoods in the Nişantaşı and Beyoğlu districts which had sizeable foreign European populations. Except for the foreign Europeans who used to inhabit the wealthy Nişantaşı and Beyoğlu districts in large numbers, very few of these religious minorities remain in these aforementioned districts as they either emigrated or moved to other districts. These traditional districts are one of the poorest districts in Istanbul, and those religious minorites who remained overwhelmingly moved to wealthier middle-class districts which have better municipal facilities and better accomodation.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by   •    

 :Istanbul's minorities still have their """"unwritten rules"""". For example, the Armenians and Assyrians almost exclusively prefer Kınalıada Island in the summers (where they have their summer houses) while the Jews almost exclusively prefer Büyükada Island (which is also the most cosmopolitan island and has other minorities, i.e. the Greeks, Armenians and Assyrians.) Burgazada, until recently, was almost exclusively preferred by the Greeks (until its beautiful southern beach and its fish restaurants became universally popular among all Istanbulite ethnic and religious groups within time); who also exist in Heybeliada and Büyükada. As for the City of Istanbul itself, to give a few examples: The Armenians still prefer Kumkapı, Bomonti and Kurtuluş (Tatavla, originally a Greek neighbourhood); the Greeks still have small groups in Fener, Samatya and Balıklı; the Jews still have small groups in Balat, Galata, Beyoğlu and Nişantaşı (the latter three districts are also preferred by the Levantines.) Of course, the numbers of these minority groups have dwindled since the early 1900s, but some """"unwritten rules"""" have not fully changed and still remain valid.    

 ::It is also importan to note that these religious minorities though concentrated in these traditional districts never were restricted nor lived like in a ghetto, as was the case among the Jews in Europe.   —Preceding undated comment added .  

 :::Nobody said that... Everyone knows that Astoria is the Greek neighbourhood of New York, but it's not a ghetto. The same thing is valid for Glendale, which is the Armenian suburb of Los Angeles - but not a ghetto. Kreuzberg is the Turkish neighbourhood of Berlin. Nobody """"forces"""" these ethnic groups to choose such neighbourhoods - it just happens.   """

 # It assumed that all masturbation was self-masturbation. But it's not; one can masturbate another person, and this is not autoeroticism. 
 # It assumed that using sex toys was not masturbation. But a vibrator is a sex toy, and using one meets Merriam-Webster's (and now this article's) definition of masturbation. 
 # It assumed that non-genital stimulation was not masturbation. I don't think this article is currently clear about this. But I expect that many experts would consider, say, nipple manipulation that led to orgasm to be masturbation.

Meanwhile, almost all proponents of CMT are just as much non-experts but are given extensive coverage in the article.

 * In rather classic name-dropping, people like Christopher Hitchens and Richard Dawkins, none of whom even supported the idea that Jesus never existed. Trying to bolster the credibility is this way is just dishonest. 
 * WP:NPOV is clear in stating that we can have articles on topics such as CMT and other fringe theories, but that we must make sure that even a casual reader understands that it's not a mainstream view, not even the view of a significant minority. Looking at some other fringe theories such as Holocaust denial or Obama is a Muslim, they satisfy NPOV by making the actual situation very clear.

I'm just not sure if it's possible to overcome its entrenched nature... I advocated removing Allmovie, a much lesser resource, but there was not interest in removing it.  I mean, if you put up the IMDb template for TfD, you will very likely see serious backlash.  Just my $0.02.   """

 Hi Daniel, just a question about the rejection of the Howard RfM. Of the original editors invited to the RfM, only one declined in the hope that would cause the RfM to be rejected. The many other editors on the list were not involved in the article or discussions for many months. They were only invited later after someone requested them, however we knew that such a large invitation of people from the deep past would never result in every one of them accepting. I thought that in this case, because we were inviting people who had disappeared from Wikipedia long ago that the RfM would be accepted even if not all participants responded.'''''' """

 :: To answer your question, it's considered vandalism because   
 There is a set format for Wikipedia articles - have a look at Wikipedia:Manual of style for an example of the types of guidelines we follow.  All articles are different, but for the total Wikipedia package to work, there needs to be some conventions followed about how articles are set out.  All articles need to have a similar look and feel, and need to convey the impression that they are part of a larger """"set"""" of articles.  The Blondie article you keep contributing is jarring both visually and in terms of its style.  Doesn't mean it's inaccurate, just inappropriate.   This format was set up before you got here, and before I got here, and it's still evolving.   

 The articles grow and are edited by consensus.  This means you have equal right to contribute but it does not mean you have more right.   If you are overruled by several people on something that you want to put in an article, you have to be gracious about it, and just accept that you don't win them all.   When several people change your edits, and you arrogantly change them back without considering that your opinion is just one of many, you are basically saying that your opinion is worth more than everyone else's.   When you then stubbornly revert back to something that has already been explained to you as inappropriate, that's vandalism.  It's not part of working in a community, where you would be very welcome if you took the time to try to understand how things work.  

 Several times you have made numerous words bold in the Blondie article.  Find me one other article here, where every noun, or person's name, or album name etc are bold, and where it has remained that way after consensus from other contributors, and I'll stop protesting.  You won't find such an article though.  Also you persistently add the """"Blondie is this, Blondie is that etc. Blondie is something else"""" statement. It looks like an advertising slogan.  It belongs on a fan page because it's strong and it's effective.  It's not encyclopedic though, and that's why it doesn't belong here.  It's a point of view, and whether the point of view is right or wrong is not the point, the tone of these articles should be neutral.   

 You obviously have a lot to contribute, but you seem to be not interested in learning how this system works.  You could actually improve these Blondie articles, because they have always been severely lacking.  I think it's a shame because you're obviously passionate and knowledgeable about this subject.

 I certainly will not shut the fuck up, how could a song entitled Wasted Little DJs rock, whatever the fuck your definition of the word rock is. To me the dialogue used by yourself suggests that its a sentiment of goodwill directed at ghastly, repugnant, scat stained squalor. Continue to disobey my leadership i will have you incarcerated, stripped of all belongings including genitalia. You will have surgery to redirect the trajectory of urine from your bladder to your anal cavity. Whilst in captivity, a team of special forces will monitor you 24 hours a day, for a 10 days, during this period your dismembered erect penis will be moulded into a replica which will be used to stimulate Sidney Cooke's fundament. If this fails to gratify Cooke's strong sexual needs you will be subject to a horrifying annihilation conducted by carnivorous scorpions, leading to ultimate death, involuntary ejaculation through a diverted path to your nipples and a feces pat the size of a mandrill. The remaining flesh and organs will be served up for evening dinner at the luxury Burj Al Arab hotel in Dubai to descendants of John D. Rockefeller and shareholders/directors of Exxon Mobil Corporation. Failing to satisfy their feasty appetites will have repercusions, unfortunately. Your demise will result in the unfortunate demise of others, some of them innocent, however all for a good cause and pre-emptive measures are always the solution to a better liberated world, free of ruthless entities. What exactly is this demise? Total Armageddon, individual cases of adversity will not suffice i'm afraid, as your bones begin to decay a destructive nuclear weapon named """"Ass Fister"""" with 600 kg of uranium-235 will be deployed from a Boeing F-22 Raptor from a height of 800 metres above the city of Dundee, with The Doghouse being at the epicentre. It will create a blast equivalent to about 130 kilotons of TNT, 10 times the power of Hiroshima, resulting in 10 miles of total destruction and carnage. With resulting fires across 44 square miles, creating hardship and suffering all over Tayside, Perth & Kinross and Fife, destroying the economy of central Scotland, creating a repair bill big enough to make Warren Buffett shit himself through his 77 year old sphincter. Insurance companies will face bankruptcy causing unemployment to soar, NHS waiting lists will rocket as Glasgow and Edinburgh hospitals reluctantly take in more casualties than are accustomed to, environmentalist groups will pray and pray, but the radiation caused by the blast will make Scotland the worlds biggest power plant, making it the most loathed place on Earth, and yet there are further conditions. If the blast fails to perish any of the four members of Fife band Sergeant, each one will be hunted down with help from brilliant psychiatrist and cannibalistic serial killer, Hannibal Lector, making their fate inevitable, however, Lector will want a slice of Sergeant for dinner in return for his help. There is still a get out clause for all but doomed Sergeant, here it is: Lead singer must sing Luciano Pavarotti number note perfect, Guitarist must put John Petrucci to shame, Bassist must put John Myung to shame and drummer must perform a perfect rendition of John Bonham's Moby Dick drum solo, if these are met then we will allow Dr Lector one carcass for dinner, the ugliest member. If on the otherhand these obstacles are not exceeded, all hell will break loose, now if your an epileptic or have mental illness stop reading now. Before Dr Lector can have his much deserved meal, their orifices are allowed to be used for sexually frustrated paedophiles as they will all have HIV and passing it on to the doomed Sergeant won't have any significance as they're destined for Dr Lectors eager stomach. Members of Sergeant will be subjected to rigorous penetrative anal thrusting from Sidney Cooke, Robert Black, Ian Huntley and Pete Townshend, the latter will then insert his Rickenbacker 330 up each of their recti causing intense agony as he thrusts in and out carving their anal walls to pieces with the machine heads. After their anus's have been irreperably scarred the 4 paedo's then reach an orgasmic climax, probably the best they've ever had. After jizzing on Sergeant, Pete Townshend then feels the need to do a shite, he feels that the icing on the cake would be feces on the face, so he squats himself on top of the lead singer and untenses his very loose sphincter, spraying fresh diarrhea onto his face This is thankfully the final curtain for the paedo's as they're taken away to let Dr Lector in to fill his appetite for destruction, ironically choking down each tasty member of Sergeant to the tune of Sweet Child O'Mine. Dr Lector is grateful for his tasty meal along with a hint of reggae sauce.

Then Teairra Mari's A&R; guy found the song while scouring the publishers for material and acquired the rights to record it for Mari. Under the law of most Western countries actually, you cannot block someone from singing/covering/recording your song, nor does one need express, written consent from the writer. It's just a freedom we have, and it allows for live performances to be possible and for shows such as idol to be possible. Therefore, in the business, it does not have much to do with the label, Myspace, directly. As for the 3-way, the logic is a bit antithetical because if the quotes say 'acquisition', then why would the previous label still be a part of it if its rights were sold off??

Of course, there are different levels of patriotism. In Ukraine, for example, where I lived, and where my wife is from, the people have little patriotism toward Ukraine, even during the USSR the patriotism never reached the levels that America had (to my knowledge the only country that comes close to this level of patriotism is pre-World War II Japan and GermanyEuropeans today certainly do not have the level of patriotism and nationalism of Americans)

 == Wizard of Oz == 

 You may have noticed they reverted your changes. The reason is that it's unsourced, so it appears to be original research. And besides which, the following counterarguments can be made: 

 # Dorothy runs away from home, taking her dog, Toto, with her, so that Miss Glutch will not be able to return and take him to the sheriff to be destroyed. At some point in the movie, Dorothy's reason for running away from home is subtly re-characterized as evidencing Dorothy's wish to pursue her heart's content. - She had already been persuaded, by Prof. Marvel, to go back home. The tornado put a crimp in those plans. The film's wrap-up comes full circle with the song """"Over the Rainbow"""", as she discovers that she's already there in some sense. 
 # After Dorothy is in Oz, and is following the Yellow Brick Road on her journey to see the wizard, she comes to a fork in the road where the Yellow Brick Road continues in three different directions. After interacting with the scarecrow, she and the scarecrow head off in one of the three directions, but it is never explained how or why they made that choice or where the other potential routes would have led. - One can infer that all the yellow brick roads lead to Oz. 
 # Dorothy and the wizard attempt to leave Oz in the wizard's balloon, but Toto goes after a dog in the crowd and jumps out of the balloon's gondola. Dorothy goes after him, and the wizard leaves without them. As it turns out, Dorothy still had the oil can with her, which would have left the tin man without any way to remedy his chronic rusting problem. - They're in a city, so locating some more oil should not be a problem.   
 # The fate of Miss Gultch is never explained; thus viewers do not know whether Toto was safe or not. - True, although it's inferred that she was swept up by the tornado.

 Hi Gurch - good to see you adding stubs to articles. Can I ask one favour though? Almost every country in the world now has its own separate geo-stub in the form CountryName-geo-stub (e.g., Italy-geo-stub, SriLanka-geo-stub). If you can add the country where possible when you stub, it'll save a bit more work further down the line. Cheers, and keep up the good work ) ...  
 :Sorry, laziness on my part. I'll try and use slightly more specific tags 
 Any help is still good work, even if it's just the geo-stub tag. I just wasn't sure whether you knew about the country tags. ...  

 Well, feel free to drop by at WP:WSS, the stub sorting wikiproject. Any new stub sorter (and any returning stub sorter from years past!) is always welcome ) ...  

 == Uncategorized articles ==

I see you responded to this warning, which I had placed on your talk page recently. Please understand, I'm not your enemy, I'm just another editor like yourself. And, just like you, I can find Wikipedia somewhat confusing and frustrating sometimes. There are some people here who may be difficult to deal with and somewhat unhelpful, but there are also many, many people here who are very helpful, kind and patient. Though Wikipedia has flaws, overall it is a remarkable accomplishment. The reason for this is because of the hard work of many people, who just like yourself, want to build and improve the project. Even though the motto is """"anyone can edit"""", it doesn't mean anyone can just do anything. There are rules and guidelines that determine just what, how, where and when, content can be added. Sometimes this 'wiki-policy' can be dense, counterintuitive and counterproductive, but overall, it does keep the project focused on it's purpose - that being the building of an encyclopaedia. You have to understand that content must be properly sourced. People can't just add whatever they want, no matter how well written or authoritative it may be. Unsourced content, even if well-intended is considered to be 'original research', and is not allowed. This applies to everyone, even scholars, professionals and academics. This way, we know that whatever we read here is a pure and supported fact, and not a guess, opinion or mistake. I'm on your side, and I'm willing to help. You can also find plenty of helpful people at the help desk.

6535960fd4441256,""" 

 Unfortunately, this article does not meet the WP:Good article criteria at this time. The main problem is the significant lack of referencing, but there are also many other issues. Here are some more specific thoughts: 

 * The lack of referencing is the most pervasive issues. References are needed for statistics, opinions, and potentially controversial facts. Some specific areas that need additional references include the sections on Climate, Demographics, Economy, Counties and Politics.  
 * The image layout needs work. There are huge amounts of white space and text sandwiched between images. 
 * The bottom part of the article, from Important cities and towns down, turns into a series of lists. These should be turned into prose, wherever possible. For example, in the National Conservation Areas section, it would probably be best to remove all but the top five or so most important parks, and instead replace the list with a prose description of how many parks there are, how much land they cover, how many tourists per year use them, a general description of the recreation/conservation/etc activities that happen there, etc. This would give the reader much more information than a list of blue links. This is just one example, the other sections that are nothing more than a list of blue links also need work. The list of lakes further up in the article is another example of a place where it would be easy to turn an uninformative list of links into a paragraph or two of prose that would be much more useful to the reader. 
 * Law and government section - This section is very choppy, with tiny subsections and a bunch of one and two sentence """"paragraphs"""". The executive, legislative and judicial branch subsections could easily be merged into the state government section, which would make the prose flow better and would make it easier to remove duplicated information.   
 * Ten dead links; some are tagged and some aren't. See here for details.  
 * Other reference issues: 
 ** What makes #7 (StarGemstones.com) a reliable source? 
 ** What makes #19, 22 (American Forts Network) a reliable source? 
 ** What is #34 (""""Zuivelzicht"""" April 25, 2007)? 
 ** References should at the very minimum have a title, publisher and, for web references, an access date.  

 Faustus, I see that you nominated several other articles at the same time as this one. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, it does not appear that you edited the articles, or at least the ones that I checked. It is generally better for editors who have worked on a particular article to be the ones to nominate it, and it also often works best for new GA nominators to nominate one article at a time, so that they can see how the process works, get tips, and then apply their new knowledge to their other articles. The other articles that you nominated that I looked at have many of the same problems with a lack of referencing and poor layout and formatting. I would suggest withdrawing them (or all but one that you are really interested in working on), and perhaps work with another experienced editor, or at a process such as WP:Peer review, until you really understand the GA criteria. Please let me know if you have any questions,   """

 :Ahah! I think I see some enlightenment here. My previous question was not related to the Arabic language in any way whatsoever. My question was about the English language, and about Islamic culture. I asked a question about English, and you apparently think an answer about the Arabic language is relevant. 
 :I think the problem here is that you're writing text in this thread which you think is an answer to a question, and when I read it it looks to me like it's totally unrelated. 
 :For example, you quoted text that was discussing """"cultural angles."""" That has nothing whatsoever to do with this discussion. American English words have definitions which do not change depending on the """"cultural angle"""" of the reader. If in the American English dialect, """"Royal"""" does not mean """"on the same level as god"""", then it doesn't. Period. Cultural angles don't change that. 

 :As to your claim about me having too many positions, you're confusing positions and justifications. I have more than one justification for my position, but my position is quite consistent. 

 :Let me try to re-state my position again: 
 :The cultural appropriateness of the word """"Royal"""" is determined solely by the definition of the word in the English dialect of the speaker. 
 :Arabic terminology? Irrelevant. I'm not speaking in Arabic. Cultural background of the reader? Nothing at all to do with the definition of a word. Anything outside of the dictionary definition of the word is only relevant if you can justify it. 

 :(One way this could be reasonably justified would be on historical grounds - it's possible that a word's current definition is not offensive, but it was previously used in a way that was offensive to a group. Even though the word's current meaning isn't bad, it still brings up memories of past injustice.) 

 :I'm not trying to """"play dumb"""" or not respond to arguments. I'm just truly having trouble figuring out how and why you think some of your statements relate to the topic at hand.

 If you receive a ticket for a traffic violation such as speeding, passing a red light, passing a school bus, unsafe lane change, failure to signal or other violation in New York City, which includes Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and the Bronx or Rochester, Buffalo and certain parts of Suffolk County, your case will be handled by the Traffic Violations Bureau (TVB) of the New York State Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV).  Outside of these jurisdictions traffic infractions are handled by the local criminal court.  The Traffic Violations Bureau only handles traffic infractions.  It does not handle traffic misdemeanors which include Reckless Driving (VTL 1212), Aggravated Unlicensed Operator (VTL 511), and Driving While Intoxicated (VTL 1192).  Please note the list of traffic misdemeanors is lengthy; please visit our Traffic Misdemeanors page for more information.   Furthermore, despite the fact that they are traffic infractions, TVB does not handle Driving While Ability Impaired charges nor does it handle traffic tickets charging a refusal to take a preliminary breath screening test (this is not a Breathalyzer refusal but a refusal to take the handheld breath screening test usually requested by the officer on the side of the road). 

 If you choose not to fight your ticket, you admit your guilt, pay the fine, and add costly points to your driving record. Why go this route when you can hire a lawyer to fight for you and prove your case? 

 Hiring a New York City Traffic Ticket Lawyer will give you your day in court, which can result in no fine and no points! Even in tough cases, a lawyer may be able to get your charges reduced to where they do not affect your insurance! During this entire process, there is no need for you to go to court or leave your home.  

 By hiring a New York City Traffic Ticket Lawyer, you can also avoid the hassle and possible administrative suspension associated with points on your record. If you allow points to accumulate on your record, it may even result in a license revocation!  

 Hiring a New York City Traffic Ticket Lawyer will also save you insurance money. When points are added to a driver's record, insurance rates frequently go up. Fighting your ticket will keep your insurance rates low! 

 Our New York City Traffic Ticket Lawyer concentrate in the defense of all types of traffic tickets, moving violations, and parking tickets as well as commercial drivers licenses, trucking regulations and violations, bus and common carrier regulations, transportation of oil and gas, movers and transporters of goods, motor vehicle and DOT regulations, drunk driving and all criminal matters, suspended/revoked driver licenses, and all other motor vehicle related matters.  

 Tips on Avoiding a Speeding Ticket 
 You’re driving along New York State Thruway and out of your rear view mirror you see the unmistakable lights of a NY State Trooper.  As the lights follow you, there is no doubt that you are about to be given a New York speeding ticket.  There are many different opinions on how to avoid getting a speeding ticket in New York.  Clearly every ticket lawyer agrees that the easiest way to avoid getting a speeding ticket is not to speed.  However, its not always that simple.  

 In the event that you are given a ticket, it is important to you remember a few key things to help mitigate the situation and perhaps avoid getting a speeding ticket.

 ==Split== 
 Over at Galileo Galilei there was talk a long time ago about splitting out the section called Church Controversy and rewriting the whole story as a separate article. The section has long been too big (putting the article as a whole over the recommended max size) and too sprawling and self-contradictory. In spite of its already large size, fair coverage of the many controversies inevitably causes the section to get longer, even if handled well. But no one ever had the time to do the rewrite. 

 Now that that section has been hit with a demand for cleanup, we really ought to undertake the job. For a basis, I have copied the whole section, as it stands, as the text of this article. This is not because the article ought to stay in its present form, but to get the old text into a convenient place in the History. 

 Then I'll change the section in the Galileo article to a brief summary, with a pointer to this as the Main Article. More on that in the the Galileo talk page. 

 Then I'm going to blank out the text of this Trial article and turn it into a stub, from which the new article can be written. It would be futile to try to make a good text just by patching the old one, which needs massive reorganization; but we'll have all the pieces of the old version from which to crib as needed. Parts of it are very good. 

 The old Church Controversy text is also being copied below as part of the talk page, as this might be more accessible than going back into the History page to find old text. 
 

 :Dandrake, this is a very impressive, NPOV and accurate article with repect to this controversy. WRT names, how about something like Galileo: the conflict with Rome ot Galileo's Conflict with Rome (or The Church or The Inquisition, etc..) The point is to get trial out of there as it is too resticted and expand it a broader concept like conflict or confrontation or something along those lines.  

 ::Usually the whole church controversy topic is known as the """"Galileo Affair"""".  It's actually the name of several books, but I think it predates the books that use that as the title; I think the commonness of the term outweighs the partisanness of it, since people have written about it using that term from a wide variety of views.  

 n fact, the new brief text from the main Galileo article has been pasted in, forming a rough outline. Let's replace this rapidly with a well-organized text (in which it will be impossible to recognize this first hack). 

 As to this article's name: it's not really accurate, as this covers far more than the trial of 1633. It is very hard to find a descriptive and neutral name. """"The Galileo Affair"""" could be one, but it's not, being the title of a book, and a partisan one. """"GalileoFor Copernicus and the Church"""" appeals to me, but that one is also taken. As is """"The Crime of Galileo"""". """"Galileo, heliocentrism, and the Church"""" would be descriptive, but it sounds pompous. 

 Any better ideas? Please?   

  
 ==Church controversy== 
 This is the former text, complete: 

 Galileo was a practicing Catholic, yet his writings on Copernican heliocentrism disturbed some in the Roman Catholic Church who believed in a geocentric model of the solar system. They argued that heliocentrism was in direct contradiction of the Bible (Joshua (10:12)): """"Then spake Joshua to the Lord in the day when the Lord delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel, 'Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon'."""" This Bible passage could be literally interpreted as the Sun and the Moon were both objects peripheral-to or a subset-of Earth, as opposed to a more symbolic, metaphysical interpretation (e.g., their representing a highly illuminated state of consciousness (the Sun founded upon Gibeon) and a phase of lower reflected intellect (the Moon in the valley of Ajalon) or thought).  At that time the most literal Biblical interpretation was prevalent with the church hierarchy, especially among the Dominican Order, facilitators of the Inquisition; it was also in line with the highly revered ancient writings of Aristotle and Plato. 

 The geocentric model was generally accepted at the time, as it had been since philosophers first considered the heavens. By the time of the controversy, the Ptolemaic model had a serious rival in the Tychonian model in which the Earth was at the center of the ["

 == Blind to the elephant in this room == 

 A few editors here have been acting as if they do not see the elephant in this room. Even if they really cannot see its big, imposing form, they surely should smell the peanuts on its breath. The elephantine point they continue to ignore is their failure to find ANY reputable source for the dubious information they insist on adding to the Demkina article. So instead, they continue to defend the non-reputable sources they've come up with. However, the pachyderm in this room is too big to be ignored. 

 The fact that they are unable to find any reputable sources for the claims of the young Russian quack is that her claims are only grist for the mills of the sleazy newspaper tabloids, like the one they insist on citing. 

 A century ago, German physicist Wilhem Roentgen announced his discovery of an invisible form of light that can be used to see inside of human bodies. At first, his announcement was met with skepticism and even accusations of fraud. But in literally a matter of a few months, Roentgen's discovery was published in a major science journal, was widely replicated by scientists throughout the word, and was publicly hailed as the monumental discovery that it was. 

 Fast forward one century:  a Russian school girl claims she can use a mysterious vision to see inside of people's bodies and diagnose their illnesses. A Russian and then a British tabloid touted her claims alongside articles on haunted houses, alien abductions, and the finding of Noah's ark. The tabloids announced a discovery that, if it were true, would be far greater than the one Roentgen announced a century before.  

 So where are the scientific publications that reported the """"experiments"""" """"scientists"""" performed on this girl that were described in the tabloids? Where are the reputable newspaper accounts on one of the most remarkable phenomena ever discovered that could benefit humankind even more than the discovery of X-rays?  They don't exist, for good reasons. As Wikipedia rules and guidelines acknowledge, reputable publications fact check. They do not willingly participate in the promotion of frauds and hoaxes - especially fraud that can harm sick people. Sleazy news tabloids and countless self-published personal web sites have no such scruples. 

 The founders of Wikipedia and the vast majority of Wiki editors have those scruples. And that's why efforts to ignore this elephant are not going to succeed. Wiki guidelines instruct editors to avoid using dubious sources of information - like newspaper tabloids and self-published material on personal web sites. They tell us that if something is important enough to report, editors should be able to find it in a reputable source, and that it is preferable to wait until reputable sources have had time to review or comment on claims made in non-reputable sources. In other words, they tell us to watch for the elephant and not to pretend it doesn't exist. The few here who inisist on citing personal web sites and sleazy news tabloids would prefer us to ignore the elephant.  """

Intuitively, an isothermal system wastes a great deal of the expansion work, because you lose the energy that you put into warming the gas when you compress it. A 100% efficient expansion would be adiabatic, that is, there would be no heat transfer between the gas and the environment at any stage. The problem with that is that you have to insulate the reservoir, and if you don't then the expansion process freezes up. This is the fundamental stupidity with the aircar proposal. Realistic systems that were not just investor scams spent a lot of effort using heat exchangers to prevent this. I suggest that a graph of the thermodynamics would improve this article."

 ==Arbitration Committee clarification== 

 This is to officially notify you of the Arbitration Committee's clarification of their decision in your case. Any Ashlee Simpson-related material is in fact covered by it. The text below is copied from WP:RFAr -   

 ====Revert limitation==== 
 2.2) For a period of one year, Everyking is prohibited from reverting articles relating to Ashlee Simpson except in cases of clear and obvious vandalism (as per definition at Wikipedia:Vandalism), with penalties as per the Wikipedia:Three revert rule. What constitutes a revert shall be left up to adminstrators' discretion. 

 See Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Everyking/Proposed_decision#Revert_limitation_2 for the alternative proposals which were considered and votes on them. 

 ====Response by arbitrators==== 
 * It is my opinion that any article which contains a link to Ashlee Simpson or mentioning Ashlee Simpson, see (what links to Ashlee Simpson) is an article """"relating to Ashlee Simpson""""; therefore falling within the articles covered by the revert limitation, if Everyking is editing with respect to that portion of an article which is concerned with Ashlee Simpson and in the opinion of an administrator reverting the article.   
 * If Ashlee Simpson-related material is put into an article, it is to that extent related to Ashlee Simpson. That's the standard a rough consensus (with some queries) of the admins applied to CheeseDreams and Jesus/Christianity-related material -   
 * We should not narrowly define """"related to Ashlee Simpson,"""" and it should be broadly interpreted by administrators.  Everyking should be made nervous about getting anywhere near anything that could be considered Ashlee-related.  The intent is to restrict him, not give him a change to win the game.   
 **That's precisely my thinking. This is an attempt to game the spirit of the ruling with an interpretation that I would think was beyond reasonable doubt -   
 * I agree with David's, Epopts, and Fred's intrepretations, although I think Fred's explanation is the most clear.   
 * The intent of the ruling, in my view, is to prevent the overzealous reversion of material relating to Ashlee Simpson. Administrators should be capable of determining when such an action is taking place and act appropriately.    20:05, 2005 Feb 21 (UTC) 
 *I concur with the above comments.  """

Homicides were disproportionately concentrated: 72% occurred in three City Council districts, District 3 in West Oakland and Districts 6 and 7 in East Oakland, even though these districts represent only 44% of Oakland's residents.http://www.urbanstrategies.org/programs/infotech/documents/2008_Homicide_Report.pdf

Your arrogance and contemptuously dismissive attitude to all other editors with whom you have any disagreement is undesirable, but when you go beyond that and start personal attacks it becomes unacceptable, and would justify a limited block. Add to that your edit-warring, combined with statements which make it perfectly clear that you have no intention of doing anything other than trying to force your own preferred version through, with no wish to compromise or to work towards reaching agreement, and we have an editor who is never likely to fit in to the way Wikipedia works, and an indefinite block becomes justified. When we add to that the nonsense you have posted in the form of unblock requests, and it begins to look as though you are either deliberately trolling or else so blind to the nature of what you are doing that you are probably incapable of collaborating with other editors, rather than just unwilling to do so. In either of those two cases unblocking you would clearly not benefit the project at all, so I am declining your so-called """"unblock request"""".

 Hi. I was wondering why this article is not considered notable. Should we add more sources? Suggestions anyone? ( ) 
 
 - I've added more sources now. Does anyone have suggestions on anything else that needs to be done to make this article notable?(  ) 

 ==Conflict of Interest== 
 Hi. Could someone please explain how there is a conflict of interest about this article? I thought conflict of interest means trying to promote yourself/someone you are associated with. Please let me know how it seems to be biased and how we can improve it? Thanks.(  ) 

 Greetings, the article does indeed give the impression that it is written by people wanting to promote MFI.  Some attempt has been made for a semblance of neutrality, but the overall tone of the article is quite pro-MFI.  Further, the intro doesn't really focus on the fundamental aspects/beliefs of the MFI.  Another issue of concern is the use of lengthy quotations directly from MFI texts, which is basically letting the """"MFI voice"""" dominate the article.  Tell you what, I can take a chop at NPOVing it in the next couple days.  In the short term, you can help me by turning all those external links into proper footnotes.  I'll go footnote your first couple external links by placing   tags around them.  Please follow that format to turn all the ELs into footnotes, and that'll help push this article into compliance.  I appreciate your interest in helping bring the article into proper WP neutrality, and submit that a properly neutral article will, in the long run, better serve MFI's interests by avoiding any semblance of self-promotion in a neutral setting.     

 Okay great, thanks for your help. I'll try to help with those footnotes then.  I too think it would be good to explain the teachings of MFI in neutral language instead of directly quoting their text, so I'll get right on that.(  ) 

 I feel that the overall tone of the article is relatively unbiased now. Does anyone have any objections and/or suggestions? (  ) 

 :There have been no stated objections to the removal of the NPOV tag in six weeks or so. Therefore I've reverted the IPs continual addition of the tag. I will be leaving the IP a message re edit warring. If this continues I am happy to semi-protect the article to prevent further edit warring.

 == Conference Proceedings == 

 EMS said that conference proceedings are acceptable citation sources. Here is a web link for a recent conference in Russia in which there were discussions about whether or not Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity is correct, 

 http://www.shaping.ru/congress/2000en.asp 

 Discussions on this controversy are still very much alive.( ) 

 : This is just more dishonesty.  I said that proceeding published by a publisher of other reliable sources could also be assumed to be reliable.  Kindly show me that these proceedings come from a publisher of reliable sources. 

 : I can't deny that the debate is ongoing, and will for a long as people misunderstand relativity.  That does not make the debate ongoing in the mainstream physics community.  Instead it is occurs off on the fringes.   |   

 And for as long as people misunderstand the simple fact that one year is an absolute measure based on the complete orbit of the Earth around the Sun. ( ) 

 == Is the Controversy Largely Forgotten? == 

 The last sentence in the main article says that the Dingle controversy is largely forgotten.  

 Do we just leave that statement in the article even though it is clearly not true? The controversy is in fact a very active and growing area of debate. Just do a google search on 'Einstein was wrong' and you will see. 

 That end statement in the main article has been inserted as an opinion by people who are anti-Dingle and whose own private research hinges on the special theory of relativity. 

 So why is it still in the article following this lengthy discussion?  

 Is it because if anybody tries to remove it, reinforcements of prejudiced editors will drafted in to restore it again? 

 If relativity was safely and comfortably an undisputed fact amongst mainstream physicists, supporters of relativity wouldn't feel the need to fanatically try to block out Dingle's message. They could all go home and relax in the knowledge that relativity is an undisputed fact. 

 But it clearly is a heavily disputed topic and hence they have to try and pretend that it is not disputed at all. 

 The moral of the story is that where wikipedia may be good for ascertaining basic facts such as dates and places of birth etc., it is most certainly not to be depended upon for information on any controversial topic whatsoever. A controversial topic will always have a band of fanatics who sit guarding their pet article day and night. 

 Ordinary people won't want to bother playing that game. Slowly and surely it will come to be realized that wikipedia is not to be heeded for opinions on controversial topics. 

 And argument will ensue in a pub and somebody will sarcastically say 'Did you read that in wikipedia?' 

 Wikipedia will become synonomous with unreliability.( ) 

 : The anon wrote: 
 :: If relativity was safely and comfortably an undisputed fact amongst mainstream physicists, supporters of relativity wouldn't feel the need to fanatically try to block out Dingle's message. They could all go home and relax in the knowledge that relativity is an undisputed fact. 
 : Let's see.  Relativity being undisputed means that people like me should step aside and let people like you put whatever you want into Wikipedia.  The anon furthermore as part of his/her argument worries that 
 :: Wikipedia will become synonomous with unreliability. 
 : That of couse is what will happen in we let poeple like this anon have their way.  Therefore those of us who support relativity are obligated to make sure that the true status of Dingle's arguments is reflected here.  |   

 EMS - you should remember that it was the pro-relativity, anti-Dingle crowd who were using this page to push their POV and to criticise and insult Dingle. Since the insulting comments and links have been removed, there has been no vandalism of this page.    

 : ???.  I'm not quote sure where that came from.  I do agree that blatant criticism of Dingle in this article violates WP:NPOV.  However, discussion of the existing criticism does not violate that policy.  More relevant is that the removal of the last paragraph (which is what this anon wants) would be POV as a pro-Dingle edit, as it would be removing all mention of the lack of respect the Dingle has amongst theoretical physicists today.  That fact and its POV obvious"

 ==Article Needs Overhaul; Not Completely Accurate== 
 I take issue with the framing with this article. First thing, the reasoning for unaccompanied children coming across the border needs to be further explained. Most of these """"children"""" are actually between the ages of 14-17 years of aged, based on information obtained from the freedom of information act. Second, Most of these unaccompanied children already have family here in the states. These family members are paying thousands per person to Coyotes, also known as human smugglers. These smugglers are bringing children to the US and telling them to turn themselves in. Also, its not discussed that 80% of those released don't attend court dates, disappearing into US society. There isn't much talk about the conditions of the facilities either. Also, its not discussed that the overwhelming of these people came because of rumors of amnesty; a majority of them believed that they would be able to stay. Because of the prospects of immigration reform, many family members here thought it was perfect timing to get the rest of their family members here, especially the children. Coyotes also lied to them and found a way to exploit the child trafficking law. This is not, as been written in the article, some FOX News conspiracy, which discredits this piece for impartiality. This has been discussed and can be sourced. This article needs a major overhaul. I'm tempting to believe that it may even be biased and one-sided."""

 A few outstanding minds like Roger Bacon stood out, but they were regarded with great suspicion by the Church.  Small wonder that Bacon had vast contempt for the prevailing knowledge of his time and he thought that he could learn more from the man in the street than from renowned scholars.  He felt that the only road to truth lay in experimentation, not in abstract statements about God, the soul, and angels.  While predicting the invention of the airplane, the submarine, and the motor car, he urged also the study of mathematics to give a quantitative basis to science.  Still he was suffering from the limitations of his time.  His main purpose was to substantiate the truth of the Bible and he believed in experimental science to ward off the onslaughts of the Anti-Christ

It doesn't even mention that the attacks are on an unnamed person widely thought to be Albertus (although many who think so may be equally ignorant of the controversy).  This identification is still a matter of debate, which should be at least mentioned on the page.  I will add specific references, pro and con, to this page later.     
 :The notion that Bacon was hostile to Albertus is well accepted in recent historical literature; it is clear that Bacon was hostile to an unnamed master and Albertus is the contemporary who best fits this description in a number of ways.  In his late Compendium studii philosophae Bacon explicitly criticizes the teachings of """"the boys among the students of the two orders like Albert and Thomas, and others, who enter the orders when for the most part they are twenty years of age and less.""""  Some earlier studies consider Bacon's unnamed master was Thomas Aquinas rather than Albertus Magnus.  Of the authors cited, Hackett and Easton have both presented detailed arguments identifying Albertus as Bacon's target and LeMay accepts this position. 
 :As always, if you can find a reliable source identifying someone else as Bacon's target, feel free to edit.     
 ::So we have two figures, one explicitly named and one unnamed and only allusively identified (such that some informed consensus about a candidate has only been established in the last few decades), but a strong case has to be made for treating those two as qualitatively different?  Alternative candidates have to be presented before a difference in the level of certainty can even be admitted? Boggling!  Even disregarding the fact that you mention one previously considered candidate yourself, that's a puzzling standard to set.     
 :::This discussion isn't very productive. The recent work of Easton (1952) and Hackett (1980) supercedes older historiography. Since Easton's study in 1952 there's been a historical consensus that Bacon opposed what he saw as the poor preparation of Albertus and those like him who taught theology without having studied natural philosophy in the arts curriculum. 
 :::We've both said our piece. If you want to edit the article to provide other well sourced interpretations of the """"unnamed master"""", do so. Then we'll have a concrete alternative to consider.     
 ::::Nope. Your piece was completely out of line. He's absolutely right th"

 ::::Jakew, the photo shows a protest against routine infant circumcision. It appears in a subsection which includes the following: 
 ::::Opponents of circumcision question the ethical validity of removing healthy, functioning genital tissue from a minor, arguing that infant circumcision infringes upon individual autonomy and represents a human rights violation. 
 ::::The image depicts an """"opponent[s] of circumcision"""", the placards reference the """"ethical validity of removing healthy, functioning tissue from a minor"""" through the words and phrases """"Foreskin is not a birth defect"""", """"Whose body?"""", """"Whose rights?"""", and through the use of the images of infants. Furthermore, the phrase """"Whose rights?"""" references """"human rights violation"""", and the phrase """"Whose body?"""" references """"individual autonomy"""". The image is very relevant to the part of the section in which it appears, bearing in mind that there is no requirement to find images which are pictorial representations of all aspects of the article or section to which they relate. The picture is illustrative and appropriate in the context in which it appears because it adds more information to this supposedly encyclopaedic article by showing the reader that some people are prepared to demonstrate against circumcision. You may not like it, but this is an aspect of circumcision opposition. It's unfortunate that we don't have a similar picture of a pro-circumcision rally (if such a thing existed) or similar, but that's no excuse for censorship. I suggest that neutrality isn't about finding a matching pro for every con (or vice-versa), and then exluding any unmatched pros and cons left over; it's about not suppressing any of the pros and cons which we take a dislike to. Instead of blocking attempts to add additional relevant information to the article, perhaps you could search for an image of activities related to one of those WHO inspired anti-HIV infection circumcision programmes you've referred to in previous discussions, and include that in the article, for example.

 == This, that and the other thing...... == 

 Yes. About the blog......its nothing special but seeing that there are a lack of """"sites"""" dealing with this subject matter that aren't as I put in the introduction to it, distasteful, it kind of aims to fill the void. Compared to train wrecks such as this site here [], I think it has turned out rather well. While most of the stuff on that particular site is quite humorous to read, the proprietor's grammar and goofy comments leave a lot to be desired. 

 As for the blog introduction, it shouldn't be taken too seriously. While you and I can have a big laugh over somebody's body count or a father throwing some of his family over a cliff, some reader might get p'od that someone is making light of a mass murder that occurred in their particular town. Considering that the blog has had over 170 some views thus far, I'm surprised I haven't received a comment similar to the one I just mentioned. Its obvious that people are reading it, as I've checked the audience rating and have seen that people from Sweden, Indonesia Paraguay and Singapore are listed by pageview. That has to count for something, right? 

 In regards to William Coleman....you'll probably be seeing a lot of people going on to """"nutter alert"""" that aren't on your list here, either because of low victim count or because of monetary gain. Its indisputable that Coleman wandered into a bar, threw gas around and was ultimately responsible for the deaths of 12 people, hence why he has an article on him. There are a few others that will be profiled eventually, such as Robert McField (we discussed him awhile back) and this new guy, James """"Bud"""" Stone. As you can read here [] it looks like a robbery gone wrong. Seeing that Stone was the one executed for the six murders and nothing was ever done to his alleged conspirators, he might be profiled at some point. I haven't quite decided yet.  

 As for Earnest Lawrence, I remember seeing this [] article on him in the New York Times about a year ago. Since it was pure conjecture on the police's part that Lawrence offed everyone, I left him off my list. I've read the articles you've posted and I'm still unsure. The articles state that a few firearms and an ax were found in the home with spent cartridges, but only fragments of the bodies were found. Now, if a non-incinerated body was found with a gun in its hand or an ax in its possession, I'd be off the fence for sure. What if one of the Drew brothers mentioned in those articles wigged out about something and killed everyone, saturated the place in oil, lit a match and then offed themselves? There weren't any survivors, so that makes things even more difficult; even the illness Lawrence is alleged to have suffered isn't elaborated on. On the same token, I remember bringing this case to your attention [] that I found equally stymieing. According to this article, four witnesses even saw Peel rowing away from the burning ship. Eventually a few trials later, he was acquitted and walked away a free man. I remember our discussion on him, and he was never listed as he was acquitted. But, it begs the question.....who killed the eight people on the boat and set it afire? Peel certainly seemed guilty from the articles I've read on him, but as far as the courts are concerned, he isn't. Getting back to Ernie Lawrence, I suppose as far as history is concerned, it will remain a mystery, and seeing that the bodies were virtually ashes, modern forensic testing probably wouldn't help matters any. 

 As for your wondering about how you could contribute to the blog, you already have. With your findings on Biswas (no wonder I couldn't find anything on the sonovabitch, the article I posted had his name screwed up!), I can place a small addendum to the posted article stating your findings....the same goes for the Wychopen article from a few weeks ago. Hopefully with some of those other obscure old familicides, other people/readers/historians might come out of the woodwork and comment on facts that they might know that I don't. One of the obscure cases I look forward to writing about is Gilbert Twigg, who I found to be a very interesting read when I saw him on here. I might even e-mail the Kansas Historical Society or state archives to see if they have any pictures/articles on the man and his crime, as there isn't a alot to work from, other than the articles you have in the references section.

 : This article is horribly confused. The article may purport to be about the word, but time and again the inaccurate stereotype - that women who don't marry by a certain age are pathetic unstable repellent worthless figures of fun fit only for humiliating, contemptuous ridicule - is just assumed to be true, and the article written accordingly. This includes tone and selection.  For example, why is some media-created reality TV """"cat lady"""" nonsense the first example of unmarried women? Why is """"cat lady"""" mentioned more than once, if at all?

The vast majority of cat hoarders are men) and structure this article more like """"bachelor"""", with only slight mention made to the inaccurate crackpot stereotype. (Look at how """"bachelor"""" handles the pejorative meaning of """"confirmed bachelor"""" - succinctly and without it taking over the article.)

To introduce the topic at hand, one or two sentences must be written to introduce the section, such as “The most common form of marriage in Islam is the Nikah” ...(brief explanation here)”. Then the discussion should go towards making the reader be aware that this isn't the only form of marriage in Islam. So, the follow-up section should read “This isn't the only form of marriage that exits in Islam. Both the Muta in Shia and Misyar in Sunnism sharing many similar properties with slight differences is an alternate to the Nikah. And both has been heavily criticized by proponent on the issue of validity and practices by those who believe that Nikah is the only legitimate form of marriage.” With this sentence you can start with an indepth look at why people are rejecting all the alternates to Nikah. The follow-up to this would be to answer the criticism and explain the point of views from the supporters of Misyar and Muta. I will be back to answer questions and elaborate on this idea.

7a037124784325fe,""" Is the NHC Awake? == 

 First off, they should have marked Tammy as a depression before turning into a tropical storm. Now, the miss Vince as a depression almost a tropical storm but luckily they have it for a hurricane.  So the questions is: Anyone awake at the NHC?  

 :No, Tammy should not have been marked as a depression. When it acquired tropical characteristics, its winds were already at tropical storm force, so it wasn't a depression when the NHC issued its first advisory. No, they are not sleeping. Vince is a remarkable entity that is not something anybody expected to monitor. Also keep in mind that, like you and me, the NHC is not perfect, but they do a darned good job. —  

 ::Well even if Tammy didn't have tropical characteristics it could have been labeled a suptropical storm.  As for Vince maybe it's the fact that it's not close to the Western Hemisphere and so no body tends to pay attention.  Again, it's all ethnocentrism at work and you cannot question that.  

 :::OK. First, Tammy didn't have a circulation before it was upgraded, but on the morning of whatever day it was, visible satellite showed a circulation. Since winds were high, it could bypass the depression stage. Second, what if Vince didn't develop any more? What if it had well organized convection, and it dissipated? They said in the outlooks that it would be monitored for more organization, and when they upgraded, it was better organized. They are not sleeping, they don't want to upgrade something that might just dissipate. What if they upgraded Tammy as a Subtropical Storm, but it never got a well-organized circulation? They would raise hype for nothing. Any other storms you have a problem with?   

 I think they already admitted they missed Vince.  I'm guessing because it was out in the middle of nowhere they didn't even think to investigate it until the satellite images showed it had clearly taken tropical attributes.   

 Okay, first I have no problems with storms. The NHC has monitored depression even if they don't develop but it's the fact that they could is why they monitor them.  Unless of course you didn't catch that in their job description.  I am not shooting down the NHC I am giving them construtivce critism.  They are after all in charge of informing us about potential dangerous storms.  So Hurricanehink maybe you should read between the lines.   

 : To be a tropical cyclone, a system must have 
 :* A closed surface circulation; 
 :* Organized thunderstorm activity; and 
 :* A warm core. 
 : If the first two conditions are met but the storm lacks a warm core it may be classified as a subtropical storm.  Tammy was a strong low pressure system but lacked a closed surface circulation until the morning of Oct. 5.  The NHC had been mentioning it in their Topiclal Weather Outlook bullitens, but until it gained a closed circulation they could not classify it as a tropical cyclone.  You should look at the histories of tropical storms.  Most tropical cyclones start out as tropical cylones with 25 or 30 kt winds.  So only minimal strengthenning (to 35 kt) is needed to have them qualify as a tropical storm.  As was the case with Tammy, it is possible for a system to become tropical when it already has 35 kt or greater winds, in which case it immediately is a tropical storm.  This is not usual, but it does happen. 
 : So I assure you that the NHC was on top of Tammy.  If there are areas of concern, they are the way Vince sneaked up on them, and perhaps more so the hurricane that struck Brazil in March 2004.  (It seems that noone is responsible for the South Atlantic, which is unfortuate given that hurricanes while rare there do on occasion happen.)  |   

 ::Then why not mention it as a subtropical cyclone? That's the point I'm getting to.  

 ::: I will assume that you are refering to Tammy.  Until the morning of 10/5, Tammy lacked a closed circulation, and therefore was not a cyclone of either the tropical or subtropical variety.  Period.  Whether you approve of it or not, the NHC got Tammy right.  |   

 ::By the way has anyone seen the NHC lately? Their graphics seem to end close to Europe and Africa you can see it for wind prob. and tracking for Vince. 

 This argument is crazy. Whoever acused the NHC with being asleep should be ashamed of themselves. The guys at the NHC work around the clock to keep us safe. Without them, hundreds of thousands instead of a thousand would be dead in New Orleans ri"

 By analogy with the US Navy, when you look at the last operational battleship in the fleet, you don't see """"Battleship Missouri"""" painted on her bows; it's just """"Missouri"""". (Well, OK, """"USS Missouri"""" or some such...)

74226b45167066a4,"== Wikipedia article traffic statistics == 

 Hello Henrik, 

 The 'Wikipedia article traffic statistics' is great! I see that Wiki's history pages get quite a lot of reading and are among the top runners in number of views.   

 For example (cut paste): 

 Thomas_Jefferson has been viewed 269532 times in 201004. This article ranked 549 in traffic on en.wikipedia.org.  More than a quarter million views! 

 I was wondering how many times a day the view recorder is updated.  I just finished making a few minor edits in the 'Thomas Jefferson' page and noticed that that page's viewer record number had not changed in the last hour.

 Thanks for uploading or contributing to Image:Russobalt.jpg. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. Suggestions on how to do so can be found  here. 

 Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. Using one of the templates at Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to ensure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template.  Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page.  

 If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the """""""" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting """"Image"""" from the dropdown box. Note that any non-free media lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on criteria for speedy deletion.

The book can be found at http://www.springer.com/978-90-481-8727-0. 

 I could perhaps make a subsection called """"Researching New Racism"""" and the book title (and Springer webpage) could go in there? I am not very familiar with how this could be done!

 I thought the thing was over and I just finished reading the discussion.  The others were right of course, I was aware of the sanction and by participating in an Arb-Com thingy I demonstrated that I was.  So since your original statement said that you thought I merited the specific topic ban that you recently meted, and were constrained only by the technicality, your original statement would naturally stand.  I would have said that earlier if I had seen it.   

 Anyway, there is plenty to edit at the fringes, not specifically in the I-P area.

It is the dominant viewpoint taught in universities by professors who use their credentials to push their political beliefs in the classroom.  WP doesn't really have an answer to this either.   This means it will be especially hard to have any balanced articles in the area at all, and why the conflict can never be fairly resolved.  I wish I could implement some ideas.

 Other notes appear more likely from an 'Elitist' attitude from old time gamers and roleplayers, and while I share many of the same sentiments, especially concerning the over inflated prices, being able to finish a game in a few hours after work (with the so-called 'dumbed down' rules) remains the best parts of a simple game system, rather than gargantuan battles that could last a weekend (those are still possible for the hardcore...). For me, there is still a satisfactry level of depth, without having to memorize a million rules, like in 2nd ed, where phases would last hours in large scale battles, and arguments would be the bane of an evenings gaming.

All contributions are appreciated, but I don't believe it satisfies Wikipedia's criteria for inclusion, and I've explained why in the deletion notice (see also """"What Wikipedia is not"""" and Wikipedia's deletion policy). Please either work to improve the article if the topic is worthy of inclusion in Wikipedia, or, if you disagree with the notice, discuss the issues at its talk page. Removing the deletion notice will prevent deletion through the proposed deletion process, but the article may still be sent to Articles for Deletion, where it may be deleted if consensus to delete is reached, or if it matches any of the speedy deletion criteria. — """

 In the US, the USDA in their 'Food Standards and Labeling Policy Book' (http://www.fsis.usda.gov/OPPDE/larc/Policies/Labeling_Policy_Book_082005.pdf) defines a """"nugget"""" to be """"irregularly shaped, usually bite-sized meat and/or poultry products which are usually breaded and deep fat fried and intended to be used as finger foods"""".  According to the USDA, """"nuggets"""" MAY be formed from chopped or formed meat, but that requires the 'nugget' term to be qualified, as in """"Chicken Nugget, Chopped and Formed"""" or """"Breaded Nugget-Shaped Chicken Patties"""".  So any company selling """"nuggets"""" in the US must conform to this labeling standard.

239316ff1946f459,"""To the editor who amended my spelling - thank you very much, I greatly appreciate it. Indeed you are correct - I wrote the section in question. In fact, I am the original author of Alibek's Wikipedia article which I took verbatim from a copyright protected book I wrote; he authorized publication of the original biography in the book. The original article was thoroughly written and without bias. And I can confirm for you that I also wrote the section below regarding crediting me with the incorrect information people keep adding to the Wiki article. 

 With regard to the small section about the LA Times article I inserted into the Wiki article, I agree - it has no business being in the article HOWEVER there are ignorant and potentially vindictive individuals who insist on using the LA Times rubbish for the Wiki article. If they stop adding the LA Times info, I will remove the section about the credibility of the LA Times article as a source. My objective is simply to expose the lack of credibility of the article so I have been thinking about re-writing that little section so that it looks more professional; this constant battle with people who do not even know Alibek yet want to use Wiki as a means to malign his character is frustrating and unacceptable to me as a reasonable and intelligent human being who believes in truth, fairness, and justice. People insist on having the LA Times rubbish in the article - the rubbish needs to be countered with the truth, which is that the LA Times has admitted to publishing lies about public figures in the past. It would be great if everyone could agree to leave out the LA Times Criticism Section (yes, I changed """"Criticism"""" to LA Times Criticism) and have just a balanced and unbiased article about the man but some people have self-esteem issues or ego issues and feel the need to try to empower themselves by writing untrue and damaging things about Alibek; I value the truth too much to tolerate this about Alibek or anyone else I know. And since he is considered a public figure (which I think the whole idea of """"public figures"""" is stupid), people talk about him and almost everything I hear is untrue according to my presence during the events in question. It's like a contest between people, to see who knows him better, and all they do is embarrass themselves in front of me, someone who does know him very well, someone who knows his strengths AND his weaknesses and therefore is not """"star struck"""" but instead is someone able to recognize both his roses and his thistle; we are all a combination of roses and thistle. I cannot describe to you how many people have approached me with an air of authority and tried to pretend like they know the man, trying to impress me with a connection to him, telling me things which they clearly have no first hand knowledge of and merely took from the LA Times article like it was a bible. If you think my response in writing on the Wiki page is """"angry"""", you should hear my verbal response when I inform the person that I know for sure he does not know Alibek and that the speaker has just lost all credibility in my eyes because clearly he is such a weak thinker that he believes such a poorly researched and obviously biased article about Alibek. NO ONE is spared from this response, not even the very, very few people in the highest levels of government who dare to try and influence my opinion by feeding me rubbish; the people who know Alibek know the article is rubbish and don't dignify it with a response. The reason why I dignify it with a response is because I am a cop, through and through, and what people try to do in front of me is absolutely criminal; my cop nature doesn't permit me to ignore the attack, any more than it allows me to ignore any other crime I see happening in front of me. Alibek is a very well respected man among the intelligent people who know him. I have already thoroughly described his character other places online and do not need to do it again here...if you do not know this remarkable man, then that is unfortunate for you. 

 With regard to the comment on inserting genes into smallpox virus, I have seen several articles describing a variety of successful processes using vaccinia virus. I also know the gentleman who the LA Times article said made the comment; he is a very well respected scientist I have had the pleasure of working with a little. I wasn't present for his interview with Willman so I do not know what he actually said or how it might have been distorted by Willman so I cannot make any judgment as to what message he meant to convey. I wish I could tell you that some of the people involved in that article have contacted Alibek privately to tell him how sorry they were that their statements were taken out of context, but that would be violating a confidence, if it were true. I can tell you that I showed the LA Times article to Bill Patrick summer of 2007 and he was absolutely furious; Bill Pat"

 :I've thought about doing this before: it would involve lots of graphs and charts. The Episcopal Church's fourth bishop was so convinced that the TEC would go extinct by 1820 that he gave up and retired. The real precipitous decline was in the 1780s and another decline in the 1920s. The problem with all these church numbers is the 'anchoring problem'. The TEC hit a Mt Everest peak in the 1950s and all the discussion since then has been anchored to those numbers. And it isn't just the TEC, all the mainline Protestant churches showed a huge spike in the 1950s compared to the 1920s. Essentially, the US experienced two Great Awakenings a century apart and everything has not glistened like those golden eras since. Cheers!  20:53"

 “Harih Om - how was your trip to kailash”? This is a question often posed to me these days, after my return from the yatra on July 15, 2006. There is so much to say; but most people are looking for a short answer. So, I feel the right answer is: I am not sure how to verbalize an exalted experience of this nature, at the minimum it was a most memorable experience that simultaneously was very physically challenging, highly spiritual, emotionally elevating, intellectually inspiring and provided ample opportunities for solitude and closeness to GOD. “Om Namah Shivaya” – “mamepemehum” – Tibetan Holy mantra. To undertake a Yatra to Mt. Kailash, is to undertake a Yatra to your own divine self. The happiness and grace that a pilgrim can experience on such a trip are beyond words.

 == Pennsylvania is not named after William Penn. == 

 The current version says: ...which Penn named Pennsylvania, meaning """"Penn's woods"""".  
 As far as I know that is not correct, it was named Pennsylvania by King Charles II, against(!) the will of William Penn. 
 Neither being a historian nor expert Wikipedia contributor myself, all I can offer to proof my claim is the Wikipedia article onPennsylvania which states: 

 On February 28, 1681, Charles II granted a land charter[26] to William Penn to repay a debt of £16,000[27] (around £2,100,000 in 2008, adjusting for retail inflation)[28] owed to William's father, Admiral Penn. This was one of the largest land grants to an individual in history.[29] It was called Pennsylvania. William Penn, who wanted it called New Wales or Sylvania, was embarrassed at the change, fearing that people would think he had named it after himself, but King Charles would not rename the grant.[30] Penn established a government with two innovations that were much copied in the New World: the county commission and freedom of religious conviction.[29] 

 This Wikipedia Article also lists http://www.britannia.com/celtic/wales/facts/facts1.html as a source. 

 Many historic books list a letter by William Penn to Robert Turner, written on March 5th, 1681 as a source. http://books.google.at/books?id=RP-IRN8PDnUC&lpg;=PA54&dq;=william%20penn%20robert%20turner%20with%20privileges%2C%20by%20the%20name%20of%20Pennsylvania%2C%20a%20name%20the%20King%20would%20give%20it%20in%20honor%20of%20my%20father.&pg;=PA54#v=onepage&q;&f;=false 

 The letter reads: 
 DEAR FRIEND: My true love in the Lord salutes thee and dear friends that love Lord’s precious truths in those parts. Thine I have, and for my business here, know, that after many writings, watchings, solicitings, and disputes in Council, this day my country was confirmed to me under the great seal of England, with large powers and privileges, by the name of Pennsylvania: a name the King would give it, in honor to my father. I chose New Wales, being as this a pretty healthy country; but Penn being Welch for a head, as Penmanmore in Wales, Penrith in Cumberland, and Penn in Buckinghamshire, the highest land in England, called this Pennsylvania, which is the high or head wood land; for I proposed, when the Secretary a Welchman, refused to have it called New Wales, Sylvania, and they added Penn to it: and though I much opposed it, and went to the King to have it struck out and altered; he said it was passed, and he would take it upon him—nor could twenty guineas move the under Secretary to vary the name; for I feared, lest it should be looked upon as a vanity in me, and not as a respect to my father, who he often mentioned with praise. Thou mayest communicate my grant to Friends, and expect my proposals: it is a clear and just thing; and my God that has given it me, through many difficulties, will, I believe, bless and make it the seed of a nation. I shall have a tender care to the government, that it be well laid at first. No more now, but dear love in the truth."""

2d39f97042f5db83,"== The proposal of the loop-closing definition. == 

 Earlier on this Talk page I proposed to take the loop-closing characteristic as the fundamental characteristic. I propose to add to that another demarcation criterium. 

 A twin scenario can be realized with one dimension of space (plus, of course, the dimension of time). Plotted in a Minkowski space-time diagram it will look like a loop, but the idea is that one dimension of space suffices to enable a twin scenario.  

 I propose to call it a 'Sagnac scenario' if and only if the spatial paths enclose an area. In the case of a ring interferometer, the size of the enclosed area of the counterpropagating beams is an operative factor for the magnitude of the Sagnac effect.  

 By adopting a convention that a spatial area must be enclosed, such a thing as a 'linear Sagnac effect' is excluded from the definition. Again, I think these are matters of conventions of how things are named, not of physics principles.  

 I expect the following: a laser with a linear resonance cavity will not show frequency splitting when it is moving inertially. I expect that a linear cavity laser can have frequency-splitting only when it is being accelerated with respect to the local inertial frame.  
 I take the Canterbury university ring laser setup as the purest realisation of a ring laser rotation sensor. The laser process generates two frequencies of light if the setup as a whole is rotating around an axis."

 As such, I suggest that the opening definition be clarified to at least make it clear that the backdoor element is not mandatory.

I am merely arguing that an honest, factual description of social liberalism does not attempt to co-opt the term """"liberty,"""" destroying the definition it has had for hundreds, if not thousands of years. An honest description of social liberalism acknowledges that social liberals believe maximal liberty is morally wrong, because it leaves people to struggle as lone individuals, potentially with a great deal of economic inequality that inhibits their personal empowerment.

Social liberalism borrows components from both liberty and socialism, but is equal to neither.

Not just the highest degree of liberty that is advisable, but the highest degree that is logically possible (as in, not self-contradictory).

Since signing to the label, almost all of G-Unit's members have released solo albums. They are the most famous and by far the most impressive and best rap group around.

 : Seeing that you only seek to publish negative things about this man, I will supply some more balanced input, with some quotes from an article in  Evenimentul Zilei, of 20 April 2006, journalist Laurentiu Ciocazanu ,in an article entitled """"The King's Revenge"""" expresses appreciation for Prince Radu, for his intelligence,humanity and committment to Romania. 

 ::""""I met Prince Radu at the Elisabeth Palace,...Prince Radu is extremely involved in his mission as a special representative of the Romanian government, a position for which he and the entire Royal Family have used all their energies of altruism. 
 ::.... 
 ::This unusual status as a special representative provides, however, the best outlet for an outpouring of love for Romania, a love that King Michael and those who are close to him have stockpiled over the years. These are stockpiles of love created over tens of years of painful exile and other several difficult years after December 1989, during which time the King's family suffered tremendously for the help they were not allowed to give to the mother-country......Prince Radu was not born with blue blood, but he lives a life too imbued by the spirit of this special group to be considered an """"outsider"""". 
 ... 
 ::The man who is now the bearer of Romania's message into the world, as well as the image of the Royal House in Romania, has much to say and does not waste his time. He travels all over America to tell the students who will run tomorrow's companies and institutions that somewhere in Europe lies a country that has something to offer. 

 ::He invites managers of big American corporations to fly into Bucharest before taking off for Beijing, because they might just discover a better place for business. He meets with friends and relatives from European royal houses to lobby in favor of Romania's admission into the E.U. on 1 January 2007. He goes to Moldova to tell our neighbors that the mother-country has not forgotten them. 
 .. 
 ::He does a lot for a position which is basically an honorary one. But he does it well and does it for a purpose, with discretion, diplomacy, background, respect, and honor. However, these are things one never sees. For everything else there's another kind of Romania."""" 

 ::In another article, in Cotidianul (http://www.cotidianul.ro/index.php?id=3618&art;=8033&cHash;=93858fe5e1) journalist Alin Ionescu admits, with surprise, that he has changed his opinion of Prince Radu . Mr Ionescu expresses his respect for Prince Radu's elegance and modesty in the way he expresses himself, his clean and relaxed  attitude,and his appreciation for Radu's evolution and growth over the past few years. 

 :Intro in Romanian: """"L-am vazut pe principele Duda in emisiunea dnei Vrinceanu-Firea si am impresia ca e alt om decit cel pe care-l stiam.""""

The audience consisted of not only Waseda faculty, students, and staff members but also diplomats, scholars, and journalists from outside the university community.

 == A simple suggestion == 

 Instead of contextualizing paragraph two by books of """"The Bible,"""" which implies a later, Christian source, the more relevant words """"Hebrew Bible"""" or """"Tanakh"""" (or both) ought to be the terms of definition.  Otherwise, one might start to think that """"Old Testament"""" translations, based upon the Greek Septaguint, are the authorities when in fact the Masoretic text of the Tanakh is considered by Jews the obvious standard.   

 :The term 'Bible' does not at all imply a later Christian source. It is a widely used term for the books considered canonical by Christians, that is not to say that they have a Christian origin. It is also a misunderstanding that translations based on the Septuagint are authoritative for Christians. Nearly all English Bible translations are in fact based on the Masoretic text. Only in Eastern Orthodox streams of Christianity is the Septuagint the standard Bible. In any case, apart from a few fringe groups, Christians realize that the authority of any translation ultimately goes back to the original Hebrew (i.e. for the books of the Bible originally written in Hebrew of course).     

 ==Failure to contextualize== 

 The """"Construction"""" section's 7th paragraph begins """"In 1967 Israel captured Old Jerusalem (and the Temple Mount) from Jordan.""""  No other information is given about this; the impression is that Israel invaded Jordan without provocation, when in fact Israel's actions in the 1967 war were in response to a mass attack upon her by Arab countries, including Jordan, after Egypt's General Nasser and the other Arab States allied with Egypt had engaged in an act of war by closing down Israel's ability to ship through the Straits of Tiran with the express and stated purpose of annihilating Israel.  This false impression must be corrected if it is to avoid being unintentionally anti-Semitic.    

 :Having a bias against Israel is not the same as being anti-Semitic. Also, I think the current statement is simply concise, not going deep into the political situation because this is not the topic of the article. However, if you feel contextualizing is necessary, just go ahead. Remember Wikipedia's policy to be bold.    """

He has a history of bullying other Wikipedia authors, including administrators of this site, and of making various threatening comments, which history is readily viewable .

953e5ff8d0bc2728,"Proposal II === 

 Ok, here's my take on this.  I agree that there should be at least one person who keeps an eye on all thing related to Barack Obama.  However, looking at everything above, all I can say is that it is way to complicated.  All those rules, regs, etc still leave many things open to interpretation, gaming, and continual confusion.  My belief is in the acronym: K.I.S.S. or Keep It Simple Stupid!.  The simpler things are, the easier they are to understand, leaving less to interpretation/gaming/etc.   

 So here is my proposal: Instead of having chairs, councils, etc, we just have Moderators.  We have at least three moderators. Each acts on their own unless one steps over the line and then it is either the other moderators or admins who will deal with the moderator.  The moderator's job will be: 
 # To make sure the the discussions on the talk pages are on the content of the article and nothing more. 
 # To make sure there is no personal attacks, sockpupptery, obvious POV pushing, or other breaking of wiki policies/rules/etc. 
 # To remain neutral and not to participate other then to settle disputes. 
 # To enforce all rules agreed upon and also to take sanctions out on people violating the agreed upon rules that include warnings and temp bans.   

 We would elect these moderators and they would stay here throughout the election period.  After the election period, we can decide upon where to keep it going after that.   

 There is probably more to this, but I can't think of it right now.  Any thoughts, etc?

 :1. 6Li reacts with thermal neutrons to form metastable high energy 7Li which may release the excess energy as 4.7 MeV Gamma ray or """"emit an Alpha particle"""" e.g. divide and split the energy between an 4He and 3H (Tritium), OR it may re-emit the neutron. 235U has a wide difference in activity between Thermal and fast neutrons; not so with Lithium. 7Li will absorb thermal neutrons to form 8Li which subsequently decomposes to 8Be then to 2x 4He.  7Li can absorb a Gamma ray and the metastable high energy 7Li will emit a neutron and 6Li. (Reaction is used when Lithium used in Neutron sources) Fast neutrons will engage 7Li in a (n,2n) > 6Li reaction multiplying neutrons. I can find no reference to irradiating 7Li with neutrons to create Tritium (tritium production would require 5He be produced as well), except as they first create 6Li. 
 :2. See Nuclear reaction and Aneutronic fusion, 2H (Deuterium) +  6Li = 2x 4He and 2H (Deuterium) +  7Li = 2x 4He + neutron are lower energy reactions and are more likely to occur. The bomb would need to be enriched in 6Li because 7Li does not generate Tritium on neutron irradiation. An x-ray absorption by 7Li would generate Tritium but similar energy X-ray would also split Deuterium into proton and neutron per Neutron source and Neutron generator articles. 
 :3. Absorption of neutron by Boron-10 generates enough excess energy to split the resulting 11B into 7Li and 4He. 
 :4. Magnesium is Zinc-like: easily pairs S electrons, monoatomic vapor, unusually low boiling point compared to Lithium which is higher then its class. Magnesium does not interchange in minerals containing Lithium, Magnesium interchanges with Ferrous ions.  
 :5. The distinction between """"Lithium"""" and """"Lithium ion"""" battery types is ignorant of chemistry. Why not just list the electrochemical potential of Lithium? Battery potential doesn't really belong. Lithium:Thionyl Chloride (circuit boards) is 3.7 volts, Lithium:IronPhosphate is 3.2 volts; I could not find a """"nanowire"""" battery at Walmart but they did have 1.5 Volt Lithium Batteries. 
 :6. The first stage of Hydrogen fusion in stars is formation of transient 2He (how unlikely huh?) with a tiny but finite possibility of becoming Deuterium instead of flying apart. Several rate limiting steps later we get 4He. H+H+H+H=He is a millenially long reaction but Suns have volume. The first step of Helium burning, 8Be, like Hydrogen fusion is unstable and forms in equilibrium amounts. Lucky the Sun can support endothermic reactions! Fusion has a diagram of fusion rates vs temperature and Helium burning tails into Proton only thermonuclear fusion. As from Neutron references above, Deuterium is decomposed by a 2.26MeV photon and 9Be by a 1.7MeV photon. I would supposed that trans-Helium elements such as Li, Be, and Boron are stable to thermonuclear conditions; incorrectly stated in this article. And I could find no isotopic reference to 10Be decay by alpha emission, it decays 100% to 10B not to Lithium.

 After merging two articles together, a redirect should be left behind and there should be no deletion.

 ::""""All citation techniques require detailed full references to be provided for each source used. Full references must contain enough information for other editors to identify the specific published work you used."""" 

 ::After all, with so much great work already invested in the article, why not go the extra mile and really put it over the top? Feature Articles like Lee Smith (baseball player) have to have full references to reach their status. The other revisions to the article for this GA review have been outstanding and spot on, so if this task is completed, I'd been more than happy to pass the article. If you need extra time to finish this (considering it's the holidays and all), I'd be more than happy to extend the hold for this great article.

 ==Serbian bias== 

 This article is Serbian oriented, biassed and does not give a neutral point of view. There are no references to the Ottoman sources that exist and not even the name of the battle in Turkish is given. The Serbian bias is so evident when a person who is an """"assassin"""" from the Ottoman point of view, Miloš Obilić, is described by as """"later a hero at the Battle of Kosovo"""". He may be perhaps be described a """"hero"""" from a Serbian point of view but he was definitely a """"low-grade killer"""" from an Ottoman point of view. By analogy one can look at the article on Gavrilo Princip, the Serbian assassin who started the First World War, and describe Milos Obilic not as a """"hero"""" but as a Serbian """"assassin"""" which he was.

 ==GA Review== 
 I can see that a lot of work has been put into this article, but I'm afraid that I'm not going to be able to list it as a GA. 

 Good Article Criteria 

 (1). It is well written 

 1(a) the prose is clear and the spelling and grammar are correct Well, I checked the Article and I could not find spelling mistakes very easily. So the article satisfies condition 1(a). 

 1(b) it complies with the manual of style guidelines for lead sections, layout, jargon, words to avoid, fiction, and list incorporation.There are a few errors here. 
 *The grihapravesam function of the new Campus was performed on July 25,1991 in the presence of Sri Jayendra Saraswathi Swamigal,and was inaugurated by Shri R.Venketaraman(Former President of India) on January 5,1992,and received approval from the All India Council for Technical Education the same year. - No space between July 25 and 1991. No space between R.Venketaraman and (Former President of India) 

 *SVCE went under the government scanner with the Directorate of Technical Education(DOTE) intensifying its drive against the collection of capitation fee and tuition fee in excess of that prescribed. 

 *SVCE has a 1,338-square-metre (14,400 sq ft) well established, fully computerized library spanning three floors with over 21,000 titles covering major fields of Science and Engineering, a conference room, an ample study space and a seating capacity of over 200.The ground floor is Air-conditioned,with conferencing, multimedia, internet, reprography facilities, a CD-ROM collection and a book bank for deserving students. 

 and many many more.......... 

 If you check the article, almost in each and every sentence, there is no space after commas. 

 And a problem in the Lead-SVCE's founding objective was to plan and implement a programme of education in Engineering and Allied Sciences, to promote research, disseminate knowledge and to foster the cooperation and exchange of ideas between the academic community and industrial organizations and to develop entrepreneurship skills among students. 
 What's so special about the objective of the college. All colleges have nearly the same objectives. These things don't deserve the Lead. 

 So the article doesn't satisfy condition 1(b). 

 (2). It is factually accurate and verifiable 

 2(a). it provides references to all sources of information, and at minimum contains a section dedicated to the attribution of those sources in accordance with the guide to layout, 

 Please fix weblink http://www.india-inc.in.+retrieved/ in citation 1. I couldn't open it. 

 2(b). at minimum, it provides in-line citations from reliable sources for direct quotations, statistics, published opinion, counter-intuitive or controversial statements that are challenged or likely to be challenged, and contentious material relating to living persons. 

 2(c). it contains no original research. 

 (5). It is stable, it does not change significantly from day-to-day because of an ongoing edit war or content dispute. 

 (4). It is neutral, it represents viewpoints fairly and without bias. 

 6. It is illustrated, if possible, by images 

 6(a). Images are tagged with their copyright status, and valid fair use rationales are provided for non-free content. 

 6(b). Images are relevant to the topic, and have suitable captions. 

 (3). It is broad in its coverage 

 It may be broad in its coverage in terms of sections like Sports, Facilities, Transport, Medical facilities, Placements, etc...But Initial Years in History section is too. short. Please rationalize it or expand it a bit. It just consists of 2 sentences. You have to put in more data. Most of the contents in the article are just lists. Even the Research sub-section. There is no mention of what the college has achieved. Awards anything etc...Same for Societies & Extra Curricular Activities..Hardly any data.. 

 3(a). it addresses the main aspects of the topic 

 3(b). it stays focused on the topic without going into unnecessary detail 

 Unnecessary details are the lists. Too many lists. Article thus goes into unnecessary details. Too. many and ov"

 == Critic's Reception on episode sections== 
 Is it necessary to put critical receptions on each episode? Family Guy has had a track history of critics hating it, or warming less to it then other shows, so why with all the nitpicking little reviews on each episode? its kinda irrelevent.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by   •    

 ==Accents== 
 These need to go, the actors basing their voice on someone from a particular region does not make it the accent of that region. It's entirely subjective. I don't know about the American accents but Stewie is reported to have an 'English' accent. Accents vary hugely in England (as I'm sure they do in the US) It's not uncommon for someone to not be able to understand a word another person that lives 300 miles away says due to accent. Accents can't be proven so they either go or it's changed to say that the voice is based on someone from (insert region here).    

 This info is quite valid, and i have replaced it. Accents are well documented, recognised, quoted, and parodied. 
 The fact that accents vary within a country is irrelevant.  
 Stewie is said to """"have what some consider an upper-class affected English accent and stereotypical archvillain phrases"""", It does not say he has just an English accent.   

 Accents cannot be proven, they are entirely subjective. """"an upper-class affected English accent"""" - is that a Mancunian, Liverpudlian or Somerset accent? There are upper-class people in all these areas. If you want to include this information state what the accents are intended to be, not what they 'are'.    

 ==No mention of """"Joe Swanson""""== 
 Isn't he the same class as """"Cleveland & Glenn"""" ? 

 """"Patrick Warburton: Joe Swanson"""" SHOULD be added to the main cast.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by     

 ==Criticism section== 

 It mentions that The Simpsons has referenced Family Guy unflatteringly twice, suggesting that the people behind The Simpsons are criticising Family Guy. However, Seth MacFarlane has always maintained that there is good feeling between the two sides (unlike with South Park).  —Preceding unsigned comment added by     

 ==Unbalanced== 
 Normally changes happen very fast on wikipedia. I am curious, if this page is so unbalanced with criticism why has it not yet shown how the show clearly violated many ethics and flat out lied by calling Senator McCain a Nazi?  —Preceding unsigned comment added by   •    

 :* You may want to look at Road to Germany.  And: They did NOT call McCain a Nazi; they simply implied that Nazi's would support him.  And, even if they did, they are well within their 1st Amendment rights to express that opinion.  But regardless of all that, if you want to add something about this, please find a reliable source to cite it.    

 I think the first thing about this topic is right.  The show often takes a Democrat viewpoint on various topics.  Some messages on the show are: republicans want to control everybody, undecided voters are stupid, etc.  There has to be some criticism on this.poketape   —Preceding unsigned comment added by   •

American accents and Canadian accents are extremely similar.  I'm pretty sure Americans are the only people in the world who can hear the difference.  Even Canadians don't realize that they sound different from Americans.   

 :I don't think I have clarified this, but in general you're right.  The New Zealand front lax vowel shift tends to be more extreme than that of Australia.  However, if you were to compare your TRAP and DRESS vowels to my American ones, they would probably be a bit more raised.  Yours would be between mine and a Kiwi's.  I was just trying to say that it's not like TRAP is never raised in Australia, it's just that almost all Kiwis do it and it can be more extreme sometimes (especially among young women), sounding closer to your DRESS vowel."

 :::Dave - the whole WP:NOR thing does take awhile to figure out.  I like to think of it this way - in journalism, you often try to pull together Facts to help the reader draw a conclusion.  You report Fact A, Fact B, and Fact C, and leave it to the reader to formulate an opinion based upon that.  That methodology is part of what """"Original Research"""" is in Wikipedia.  Biographies on Living Persons, especially, are treated somewhat gingerly to avoid legal issues, and to be fair to individuals, who do change over time. 

 :::Reporting what is on someone's IRS forms as income is typically not 'notable' for wikipedia purposes.  If you think this specific information should be included, finding a primary verifiable source that can also be considered 'notable' is a good start.  It *seems* like you're reporting the subject's salary as a ways of suggesting (without saying so) that the subject made too much money off of CRI.  Simply reporting the financial data leaves a lot open for interpretation, which is not really encyclopedic.  The data, itself, doesn't identify what portion the """"significant reimbursement"""" entailed, and isn't an actual PRIMARY verifiable source with factual or analytical reporting.  There is no interpretive content in the source, and its linkage to the article isn't obvious w/o 'original research'.

 == Notification of my last RfAr request? == 

 Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Clarification#Request_for_clarification:_Abd-William_M._Connolley 

 It's looking pretty grim right now. ArbComm appears to consider the offense of clear and strong argument on an article talk page  one article  more important and more worthy of a ban than an administrator previously admonished by them for using tools while involved, repeating that, with the same action during the case, and consistently and tendentiously raising rejected arguments about copyvio, and banning users by presenting highly deceptive arguments at AN, while defeating the sense and intention of many ArbComm decisions. 

 All that matters is how long an argument is. Write too much, ban! 

 This was my problem with this RfAr. Yes, I could have presented a shorter request. However, I already spent a day writing and boiling down this one. I realized that I just didn't have the energy to go further, to put another day into further condensation for political effect. I don't gain a thing from being able to edit Wikipedia on the topic. I don't gain a thing from being unbanned except for a possible ability to help out occasionally on a topic where I've become expert; I'm COI, so I couldn't do anything controversial with the article anyway. Why should I bother? 

 So I just filed the damn thing. If ArbComm doesn't want to look at it  it's dense with information about the situation, and the purpose was clear  if they just want to imagine that """"the editor didn't change,"""" which is preposterous, they can certainly do that. I stopped editing that Talk page, almost entirely, before being banned, because it was useless if the article was owned, as it was. 

 They don't care if the article is owned. They passed General Sanctions, but the only application was to ban me, based on about a month of discussion that the banning admin acknowledged was """"not a problem, in itself,"""" when another editor at the same time continued a long-term pattern of tendentious editing, removal of reliably source material, without any seeking of compromise and consensus, previously banned for this and then recently indef blocked for the same, but on other articles, and the admin previously sanctioned for use of tools while involved continued his prior campaign against old enemies (I'm only one of them!), etc., etc. They don't care! All they care about is that they don't have to read the complaint, and look at the evidence, too much work! And they are not interested, my experience, in how the structural problem of too much to read could be addressed.) 

 Experts are always interested in their topic! What do they expect? 

 In any case, this will leave me freer, if ArbComm ignores the implications, as it seems they are wont to do. I will have exhausted due process, which I had not done before. I respected the first ban, and had respected this second one. With due process exhausted, my compliance becomes no longer a matter of obligation, I have nothing to preserve, no quid pro quo. I've rigorously avoided disruption other than related discussion on an article talk page. I do not know what I'll do, and ... I wouldn't say if I did. 

 I'll say this, though. There are promises implied in """"the encyclopedia that anyone can edit,"""" and """"the sum of all human knowledge,"""" and there are obligations that arise naturally. Because the defacto process at Wikipedia compromises neutrality, which is essential to the understanding and realization of human knowledge, and because Wikipedia is standing in the crossroads, it becomes an enemy of human knowledge; many others have concluded this before me. I was holding out, and this may be why I left it for so long to appeal the latest topic ban. I did not want to conclude that. 

 Wikipedia has not seen what would happen were I to treat it as a battleground  as has been claimed about me and others. I rigorously followed policy and respected blocks and bans, even when they seemed preposterous to me. At the end of the road, however, there is no road, no confining path, I can move in any direction, unconstrained by expectations. 

 I have my work at Wikiversity, which has been quite successful, for what little has been done. An extensive discussion with a user with a knowledge of physics there, at subpages of v:Cold fusion might seem to have been much hot air, but it led to a recognition of a lacuna in the experimental evidence on cold fusion, and there was a study done by an expert in response, which means that discussion led to the advance of human knowledge. (The expert is a skeptical one, by the way, but he concluded that the objection being raised to certain excess heat measurements was bogus.) While there were other reasons to consider this, independent verifications of results and experimental contro"

  You should wait for others to write an article about subjects in which you are personally involved. This applies to articles about you, your achievements, your band, your business, your publications, your website, your relatives, and any other possible conflict of interest.  

 Creating an article about yourself is strongly discouraged. If you create such an article, it might be listed on articles for deletion. Deletion is not certain, but many feel strongly that you should not start articles about yourself. This is because independent creation encourages independent validation of both significance and verifiability. All edits to articles must conform to Wikipedia:No original research, Wikipedia:Neutral point of view, and Wikipedia:Verifiability.  

 If you are not """"notable"""" under Wikipedia guidelines, creating an article about yourself may violate the policy that Wikipedia is not a personal webspace provider and would thus qualify for speedy deletion.  If your achievements, etc., are verifiable and genuinely notable, and thus suitable for inclusion in Wikipedia, someone else will probably create an article about you sooner or later.

 I just made some changes that I'm sure will bother some people.  I cleaned up and removed some biases from a few sections and even removed a couple paragraphs.  I didn't want to, but the article is so incredibly biased.  It sounds like it came from 1960s academia rather than modern hypnosis or even 1960 hypnotherapy.   Claims like """"anyone could be hypnotised except perhaps the very young.""""   What is that about?  Modern hypnotherapy knows that young children are amongst the easiest to hypnotise.  Also the suggestibility studies need to be better referenced and discussed.  They some real harm to the field of hypnosis.  The main criticisim is that they had a single induction tried on many people and then drew all sorts of conclusions about hypnotizability that are just plain wrong.  There is no single induction in hypnosis.  It's a dynamic experience with constant two web feedback going on.   I hope someone will rewrite this whole article.  I thnk it needs to be written in a way that covers all the major views without bias, have proper formatting structure, and definitely stops taking the 1960s academic views for granted.

 :Actually, I said: """"If you have any evidence to prove this assertion..."""" Proof requires conclusive evidence, and so once again my position hasn't changed. Your comments about the requirement of any evidence are therefore a straw-man argument and irrelevant. As for the TRC's evidence, it is maddeningly vague, and much of it is second-hand reporting, such as Graca Machel claiming about a plot discussed in Malawi to kill Samora Machel, when she could not have attended said meeting, and Abdul Minty reporting on what SAAF members said, without there being direct testimony from whichever SAAF members it was. And neither Graca Machel nor Minty could be said to be objective relayers of information in this matter.  
 :That said, I have never said outright that SA did not kill Machel, I have merely stated from the beginning that there is absolutely no conclusive evidence to prove that it did, and therefore to claim outright that he was murdered by the Apartheid regime is an inaccurate statement that is unsupported to what available evidence exists. So why not add a sentence to the article which states that it is widely suspected that SA killed Machel, but that there is no conclusive evidence? — '''' """

I have no love for getting the wool pulled over my eyes, and a lot of people are still stinging from that.  Instead of pompously declaring the Grand Solution, I'll instead suggest that 1. NPPers and admins should be treated like humans instead of allowing people to treat them like shit with impunity (I've been told to fuck myself with a knife for blocking someone and had my intelligence questioned for closing RfCs certain ways; I'll live, but most people would never put themselves in that position) 2. pursuant to that, actually acknowledge we do a good job (more for NPPers, but admins run into this as well) and 3. let us crack down on obvious bullshit if we see it without being hounded to death about process (I only got away from the caste example above because the area is under discretionary sanctions, and editors disagreeing with me would have to go through ArbCom or the community).

 In Hepburn romaji, or all romaji? Consider the following: 

 It is stated that any kanji beginning with d in romaji can be doubled. So じ (zi in Nihon-shiki and Kunrei) and ぢ (di in Nihon-shiki and di or zi in Kunrei) can be doubled. Except that じ and ぢ are both ji in Hepburn and therefore cannot be doubled. You need to use the kana not the romaji spelling of the kana to explain which kana can be used with the sokuon, because not all romaji systems transliterate all the kana the same. Of course, you may know that the sokuon is never used with じ or ぢ, but someone just learning Japanese (like myself) won’t.   07:56, 15 February 2015"

I think that's where the """"multiple sources"""" idea is important. Yes, generally Wikipedia does not require multiple sources (unless a source is challenged), but this article is unique in that sometimes it is difficult to determine whether a misconception is widespread.

eeac7dd94bc56bb0,"There was an original study that showed that people with GS had 31% slower processing of acetaminophen, so it was thought to be processed by UGT1A1, the enzyme deficient in GS. The advice given was for people with GS to avoid acetaminophen. Later experiments showed that acetaminophen was actually processed by UGT1A7, and so acetaminophin was given the green light for people with GS. Later still, it was shown that most people with the UGT1A1 mutation ALSO had an even worse mutation in UGT1A7. This explained the results of both the previous studies, and justified the results of the original experiment - that people with GS should avoid acetaminophen (Tylenol).

 == Formation == 

 On 15 & 16 May 2011 some text and an in-line citation were removed from Meander#Formation and replaced by the following new text. (See diff.): 

 :In order for a flow to have a curved path there must be a centripetal force inward that is present (this is similar to spinning a bucket on a string, but here we do not have solid body rotation ie. a spinning record).  The force presents itself as a pressure gradient outwards (larger pressure on the outside of the bend then inside) or from a change in elevation at the free surface (larger elevation on the outside of the bend).  At the free surface of the river the pressure must be constant, equal to atmospheric pressure, so the elevation must change to maintain the curved flow.  In the middle (in the vertical) of the river a pressure gradient is present to maintain the curved flow.  At the floor of the river, the no slip condition requires no velocity.  This sets up a situation that has lower velocity at the floor which is not enough to overcome the pressure gradient and a secondary cross flow develops (into the bend at the floor).  The secondary flow into the bend at the floor due to the pressure gradient must eventually go up due to conservation of mass and the flow is outward above the floor.  This entire situation is very similar to the Tea leaf paradox. This secondary flow caries sediment from the outside of the bend to the inside making the river more meandering.Cite CallanderCite Falcon 
    
 :It is a misconception that the flow at the outside is faster then the inside (which would be true for solid body rotation which we don't have here), it is actually the opposite.  We consider the flow to be irrotational for the most part here, which requires the flow outside to be slower than the flow inside (otherwise the flow would not be irrotational.)Cite Lewalle 

 I have now restored the original text as follows. (See diff.): 
 :Flow of a fluid around a bend is vortex flow in order to conserve angular momentum. The speed of flow on the outside of the bend is fastest, and on the inside of the bend is slowest.Cite Hickin The water surface is also super-elevated towards the outside of the bend, so on the floor of the channel the water pressure is greater on the outside of the bend than on the inside of the bend. This pressure gradient drives a cross-current towards the inside of the bend.Cite Hickin 

 The end result is that some of the ideas are now duplicated.  There is a need to rationalise what is there by removing any duplication, unsourced statements and unencyclopedic language. 

 My thoughts are that the new text is a bit too like a textbook for teenagers and not enough like an encyclopedia.  Any other thoughts?  '''' """

 ::Of course there is no reason to delete any comment, but there are enough people who do not like criticism of the Apple brand. Anyway: There is no proof that this is paid-for product placement (at least to my knowledge). However, the recent recurrences of the """"(M)apple"""" brand in """"The Simpsons"""" do very rarely correlate to the dramaturgy of the plot, let alone separate jokes. E.g., in this episode, why are almost all smartphones shown with the (M)apple logo? Why are the iMacs there (the joke would have worked with other computers or items, too), plus all the other MacBooks (except for Lisa's)? I would go as far as saying that the Simpsons buying a new (M)apple computer here may be reasonable from the writers' point of view, as they have the opportunity to include jokes about the sometimes polarising Apple brand. But considering Apple's history regarding product placement (which is often enough very blatant), and the recurrence of the (M)apple brand since the Simpsons' 20th season, and especially in this season, I would conclude that this is most definitely paid-for product placement, and also one of the worst examples of it I have ever seen.

 :*You may have a point, however, your view is not that of the current community's will through policy.  The community decided they wanted AFD's basically dismissed without discussion in certain very limited circumstances.  Basically, it results in the speedy keep criteria being akin to the criteria for speedy deletion, which boils down to the practice basically being """"if you have to think too much about whether to speedly delete something, you shouldn't.""""  Both boil down to the end result where, if done correctly, no reasonable user would disagree with the decision reached.  My point wasn't that we want low-quality deletion noms, but that nothing is going to get deleted based solely on one  an AFD nom is akin to riding a bus down the interstate at meal time; you might toss out what you want, but unless you convince a few folks you're right, you're not getting your way, that is one of the beauties of our AFD system, and what Boelyn did was far better than running around throwing up hundreds of poorly-researched PROD tags; apathy at PROD results in deletion, apathy at AFD produces an WP:NPASR close.

My only alternate suggestion would be perhaps to limit it, not to a particular absolute magnitude threshold, but to the 100 most luminous stars known in the Milky Way galaxy, or something like that.  In any case small errors in photometry and distance estimates will make the threshold somewhat ambiguous and arbitrary.  I favor limiting it to our galaxy mostly because of the difficulty in excluding close double stars, which has already been a problem for Eta Carina.  Another question is what to do about variability.  I would tend to favor excluding transient outbursts (novas & supernovas, surely) and maybe try to get the average bolometric luminosity for others.  The need to get data at different wavelengths all at the same time complicates to problem for variables (possibly fatally for non-periodic variables?), but the bolometric luminosity may be more stable for periodic variables, I'm not sure. I suppose we would not want to exclude the 19th century outburst of Eta Carina, but I have no clue about a fair estimate of its bolometric luminosity, except to extrapolate from V, assuming a black body."

Saying that the meetings are """"kept from the 'common people'"""" is sneaky and inherently POV. An encyclopedia is to supposed be neutral and present the facts in an objective manner. While those facts may reveal unpleasant truths about their subject, they should not be mixed with value judgements. For example, the sentence """"Hitler believed that jews were an inferior race, and he killed 6 million of them."""" is preferable to """"Hitler was a racist bigot, and he brutally murdered 6 million jews.""""

 Thanks in advance for your time.  

 I was on the Northridge, Los Angeles page http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northridge,_Los_Angeles and I noticed that the photo they have at the bottom (under noteworthy residents) depicts the wrong person. I don't even know why the Northridge, Los Angeles page even needs a photo of a completely irrelevant MLB player just because he was from thereperhaps a photo of Jason Collins, the first openly gay NBA player, would be more relevantbut in any case, the photo on the page shows Daniel Nava of the Boston Red Sox, but is labeled Ryan Kalish, formerly of the Boston Red Sox. Daniel Nava, at least according to his page, is from a different place in CA.

 == Naming historians in the text == 

 Although, as those unfortunate enough to be """"regular readers"""" here will know, I have often defended the use as sources in the article of one volume histories like Duffy, Norman, Vidmar & McManners (of the Oxford Illustrated History), I now think we should avoid attributing views to them in the main text, if the views are not especially linked to them in the overall academic context, which I think is generally the case in the examples now in the article.  Norman in particular is named 3 times (& linked twice btw) in the main text, once in contrast to Duffy on the 1st century, on which neither are specialists or would I'm sure want to claim any originality in their views.  Norman's other two text mentions are in the context of areas & periods closer to his specialism (I'm not sure how close), but we are only referencing his general work, not a more specialised one.  I think it would be better at points like these to have a footnote pointing to the general histories taking different views, but only name historians in the main text who have made an important original contribution to the study of the issue at hand, or produced the """"standard work"""" on the subject.

 ::::*Apology accepted. The point I think you're missing is that, regardless of where the cars are actually built, Alpina and BMW are separate companies owned by separate people. The fact that the American branch of BMW choose to act differently on occasion does not really change that - it's not uncommon for national dealers to market different things to the main company, but that doesn't make them officially sanctioned. I'm certainly not going to argue that it is a clear-cut case or that things are simple here; we both know that doing so would be stupid. The verifiability of the information is a secondary issue to this, as I am well within my rights to remove long-unsourced content that is barely relevant to the article. The BMW articles are, to be blunt, in a big mess right now (not that they are the only ones, but they are amongst the worst examples of globally-significant car articles I've seen), and they need a lot of tidying up, trimming down and cleaning up - the Alpina removals were only a small part of the cleanup job that I started with. What I will say is this; if we were to get proper articles on the individual Alpina models, as I believe is necessary/desirable (and I presume you'd agree on that front?), then a brief mention (a couple of sentences or so) of the Alpina cars in each article is probably justifiable - the same would go for the other noteworthy tuner cars perhaps, like the Hartge H50. The level of detail that some of these went into, however, isn't, in my opinion, appropriate for the main BMW model articles.   """

 ==Misleading intro text== 

 Here are the final two sentences of the opening paragraph of this article, as they currently stand... 

 """"Because under some versions of the bill those who may be held indefinitely include U.S. citizens arrested on American soil, the Act has received critical attention by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and media sources. But the final version of the bill drafted by the Senate-House conference committee exempted U.S. citizens from the requirement for terror suspects to be held in military custody and included language stating that the bill did not extend new authority to detain U.S. citizens."""" 

 This is highly misleading because it makes it sound like the final version of NDAA doesn't state that the President can have the military detain U.S. Citizens indefinitely - which it most certainly does. Let's examine the above sentences more closely: First it begins, """"Because under some versions of the bill those who may be held indefinitely include U.S. citizens..."""" No - the final version of the bill states that anyone may be held indefinitely, and that includes U.S. citizens.  Here's the second problem: the second sentence begins with """"but"""". This implies that the content of the second sentence will contradict and supervene what immediately preceded. In other words, it promises that the following sentence will somehow answer the critics complaining about detention of citizens mentioned in the first sentence.  But what follows is a statement that """"the final version of the bill... exempted citizens from the REQUIREMENT for terror suspects to be held in military custody, and included language stating that the bill did not extend NEW authority to detain U.S. citizens.""""  This is no counter to at all, if you understand the structure of NDAA.  

 What NDAA does is (1) Say the president can indefinitely detain anyone, (2) Requires that he do so when it comes to non-citizens, and (3) exempts the president from that REQUIREMENT when it comes to citizens.  In other words, the President stated to have the OPTION to detain citizens indefinitely - and THAT is what the critics are opposed to - NOT the REQUIREMENT that the president do so, but the statement that he MAY do so. The second part of the second sentence above, says, """"included language stating that the bill did not extend new authority to detain U.S. citizens"""". This too is irrelevant in that even if that were true, it doesn't change the fact that it is another piece of legislation that ALLOWS for the indefinite detainment of U.S. citizens, even if other legislation before has done so too. 

 The phrasing of these two sentences leaves the reader with the POV impression that this is a bill that had some versions of it before completion that caused controversy, but which was changed in the final version to leave out what the criticism was about - and that is completely misleading. It also makes me think the author may not understand the true nature of the legislation. 

 Here is what I propose as a replacement for the final two sentences (which I will do myself if I get no further input)... 

 """"Although the final version of the bill does not require indefinite detention of U.S. citizens suspected of terrorism, those who may be held indefinitely include U.S. citizens arrested on American soil. The Act has therefore received critical attention by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and media sources.""""

 """"No foundation appears for the guess that the word originated in ‘a contemptuous allusion to papal edicts’, nor for the assertion of the ‘British Apollo’ (No. 22. 1708) that ‘it became a Proverb from the repeated Blunders of one Obadiah Bull, a Lawyer of London, who liv'd in the Reign of K. Henry the Seventh’."""" 

 I'm sorry, but I don't know how to cite the OED, as I have the electronic version.    

  

 Oh wait, I take that back. This is how they have in the OED:

 Hipocrite is a hypocrite, a sock puppet of Wikipedian sysop Guettarda, and an all-around cumbucket. He has no grasp of civil behaviour. When the ED article was up for deletion during EDGate2006, he tried to recall a kindly admin that voted to """"keep"""" ED. Hypocrite hangs to the coattails of his admin account MONGO like shit to a bear’s arse. He is a bureaucratic fuck of Biblical proportion, and a wannabe Wiki admin. He also appears to be a good wannabe journalist named Bob Djurdjevic.  Hipocrite is a well seasoned troll who has been around since the days of the Usenet Meow Wars. 

 ==His name defines him== 

 But of course he cares about policy, so much that he nuked a full length article into a THREE SENTENCE STUB. He has been requested to trim up the article on uncyclopedia, which boarderlines on fellatio. He routinely violates WP:DICK, WP:ASSHOLE, and WP:DOUCHE and yet hides behind Wikipedia policy to justify his shameless trolling, Whilst all the while baiting other legitimate editors into flame wars  . 

 ===More Hypocrisy=== 
 *EXAMPLE: juvenile comment """"get my wikidick sucked"""" right after saying someone else was a troll Then continues with troll comment  Are we sure he's not a child? 

 ===Criticized for vandalizing other people's work=== 
 Hipocrite also edits with an attitude that he is God, and it was once attempted to hold him accountable by people not afraid of his inevitable hurling of his own feces. As always, when cornered with proof of his bullshit, he shoved his flaccid penis in his right hand and begin rocking back and forth, chanting """"Troll sockpuppet, troll meatpuppet, puppet puppet troll,"""" while licking out the anus of a $5 hooker he picked up. 

 Unfortunately, MONGO rigged the Request for Comment and MONGO banned anyone who said anything negative about his sockpuppet, Hipocrite, forever.  Then MONGO hides the negative comments.   When someone reverts MONGO's coverup, MONGO bans them, too.   Then MONGO hides it again.  

 ==What Hipocrite's fans are saying!==

Burro is the male hybrid of a donkey and a mare. The female is a mula (mule). Actually the phrase does not refer to an undetermined colour, but to a colour that CANNOT be determined (since the ass has gone away). It is a humorous definition of infalsifiability. Moreover, equine colours in Portuguese are a mess, with a myriad terms that vary in definition from region to region and from animal to animal (a """"baio"""" horse is not the same color as an ass of the same color). This adds difficulty to know the actual colour of a burro unless the animal is present.   """

 Thanks for looking at my RfC and giving an honest assessment.  The fact is that I have been agressively coming back at Jemptymethod since he started accusing me of putting a map to his house on his talk page using a sockpuppet that clearly belongs to Catmistake.  I've tried to convince Jemptymethod that he can indeed go to the police to get a court order for the information to find out just who posted that map. Instead, he continued to slander my name so I came back at him agressively.  If you look at Jemptymethod's talk page history, you will see that I first came at him civily, but as he continued to threaten me and get agressive, I did the same.  As he started stating that he was doing google searches for me, I started doing google searches for him. As he started posting my name on Wikipedia and threatening to call my employers and give them the same nonsense he's feeding me, I started hosting his name and the information I found about him.  I demanded an appology because he's already slandered me. I will continue to badger him until he either shuts up or appologizes and agrees to seek his vendetta against Catmistake with the right authorities.  In any case, I do agree that I've not behaved 100% as I should have and I do agree that it took me a while to mellow out here, but the only person that I didn't deserve to get any crap from was the one person that continues to harass me.

 Not really knowing the rules on inclusion, I don't have any firm opinions on whether or not the Irgun should be included in the Resistance Movement category. Supporters of the Irgun would obviously see it as a resistance movement. Opponents, which, at the time, included the majority of the Zionist movement as a whole, probably wouldn't. Arthur Koestler, the author of Promise and Fulfilment, counted as one of the Irgun's supporters. I can't remember whether he was actually a member, but he actively worked for the Irgun. Promise and Fulfilment isn't a great source. It was published in 1949 before much of what is known today came out. Therefore it reports propaganda as fact. It is also very biased. Koestler either didn't understand all the points of view or didn't want to present them. He also was either ignorant of facts which counted for the opponents of Zionism, or against the Zionist cause, or he deliberately omitted or misrepresented them.        ←     """

 == Quick Vand Question == 

 I did a bit of RC patrolling this evening, and I wondered about something.  When is the slate wiped clean for IPs, so when should you start again with the first warning?   

 :It depends. If it's a shared IP address (indicated on the talk page), then it's likely that many different users are using that specific address. If you think that a user is experimenting with Wikipedia for the first time, you may give him/her a first-level warning. But since you never really know if you're dealing with a new user in these cases, you have to use your intuition. 
 :For static IP addresses (one user per address), it's easier. Then you're dealing with the same user the whole time, so you only have to use the first warning once (the first time).   

 == This is Barnstar., ==

 == Serious Concerns About the Use of Sources == 

 Assuming this article will survive the current AfD, then serious scrutiny must be given to the use of all the sources Warden has added in his attempt to expand this page from a dictionary definition into a full article after he had the speedy delete reversed. The most conspicuously troubling is this verbage of Warden's: 
 :""""In selecting candidates for the NASA's scientist-astronaut program, the National Academy of Sciences said that perspicacity was the most important quality required(footnote)"""" 
 :Indented line 
 This is a distortion of the source. The source is one of the light, short general interest pieces Science publishes in its first few pages, before the peer-reviewed articles. It is dated October 7, 1966. The article never says that perspicacity was the most important quality required. The article quotes a recruitment brochure that uses the word """"perspicacity."""" To further show how dated this source is, the article states:  
 :""""Women scientists are not ineligible, but, as one NAS panel member put it, they have a strike against them. An astronaut's training is long and costly, he observed, and there will be 'no time off for having babies.'"""" 
 The training brochure's choice of the word """"perspicacity"""" is likely nothing more than an artifact of the general writing style at the time, a style that also included phrases like """"vim and vigor"""", even in cigarette ads. The words """"acumen"""" or """"discernment"""" might have just as easily been chosen by the copy writer, the article does nothing to establish """"perspicacity"""" as a notable concept. It seems Warden is just seeking out examples where the word was used in a sentence to pad the article, and his misuse of the above source is very troubling.   """

 I sincerely hope not. Why in the world would they not want to make this product for the mass consumer?

 :::::::::::::::::5. For example, whereas Courtois writes about """"Communist genocide in Cambodia"""", many authors prefer to speak about national specifics and historical background of the genocide perpetrated by the adepts of weird agrarian Maoist ideology with strong smell of racism and fascism, and to show a dramatic difference between Khmer Gouge and, e.g. European or Soviet Communists. The problem is that such authors never tried to come out with any combined estimate of Communist death toll, simply because they see no much reason for that (no significant commonality between those events). 
 :::::::::::::::::6. We have many sources that discuss motivation of the authors of the BB, and of Courtois in particular. My conclusion is based on that. Similarly, motivation of Rummel is dictated by his libertarian views (I don't remember where I read that, but I can try to find).   """

I also had exams so I barely had time to sleep. Will get back to wikipedia once shit slows down a bit. mean while stay safe and keep up the good work )

08b258ef7d25412f,"The connection with the stopped watch is that in both cases there's a solution that works only if you ask the question for which it (the watch, or the simple solution) produces the correct answer.  It's like using Pythagoras' theorem to determine the length of the third side of a 6-8-X triangle without saying anything about whether the triangle is a right triangle.  Yes, X is 10 if the triangle is a right triangle, but Pythagoras' theorem only applies if the triangle is a right triangle, so unless it's given that the triangle is a right triangle or you can somehow show the triangle must be a right triangle based on what's given, using Pythagoras' theorem is unjustified.  Similarly, showing that the unconditional probability of winning by switching is 2/3 for the MHP (which is what the simple solutions do) when asked about the conditional probability is not a complete answer unless you also say something about why these two probabilities must be the same. 

 :::::::::You don't need to take my word for this - it's exactly what Morgan et al., and Gillman, and Lucas, Rosenhouse, and Schepler, and Rosenthal, and Grinstead and Snell, and the others I keep mentioning are saying.   And, since Wikipedia doesn't care what you think or what I think, and there are plenty of reliable sources that present unconditional solutions without justifying their answer must be the same as the conditional probability it's perfectly fine to present these sorts of solutions.  What I'm saying is NOT fine is presenting these solutions as if they are the undisputed way the problem should be approached.  This isn't a difficult concept - I'm perplexed why we have to keep arguing about it."

 :::Sorry for taking so long to reply. I wrote this long reply yesterday and ended up discussing a little of what I've been working on, when I had an insight and went with it. Why I'm going to close my account is complicated. It's part of a much larger thing. In a month or two I'll be beginning the process of fashioning a new identity by changing my legal name. I was born a nominal member of an incredibly pretentious and loathsome family, homeowners and club members in an exclusive zip code and the like. They disowned me when I was five years old, when my mother divorced my father, and I grew up in a lower middle class income household. When we had contact I was more often than not treated like an illegitimate mistake and a servant because even though my lineage was theoretically superior these parvenus had a great deal more money than my mother's family and it made them feel powerful to badly treat their social betters where it matters and whenever they could get away with it. I'm in my early 30s and still have their hateful name, which I haven't been able to speak for years, and live in the same state. What I read on my driver's license is not a name but a curse.  

 :::My identity here is still an aspect of that. It's still poor me looking at my pedigree and telling myself I'm better than them, hoping my long dead grandmother will come and save me and put them in their place. She was prevented and it has all been over for many years now. I also realize it's meaningless because I don't belong to Society even if I theoretically could. My mother could join the Daughters of the American Revolution but she hates all of that. Society can go fuck itself. I'll make my own. 

 :::This loathsome family are not one of those I have mentioned here before, who are at least of minor note. In this case I'm talking about nobodies, corporate scum and their brood, tennis people. Fuck them and their Pretentious Island Club. My mother turned down an offered membership because they don't admit Jews and Blacks or any ethnic people and she has some ethnic friends, and because she didn't need it. Her family were established before it existed and my pretentious """"grandpa-to-be"""" showing off his Rockefeller cocktail buddy (actually a good guy) didn't help because it artificially lowered her relative status even further. This event contributed greatly to my later being disowned.   """

 Wow, I'm mad, but what Al Kahn said is making me further furious. """"Kids today don't read""""? Dude, kids read comic books. A lot of them. Or does that not count? And also, """"Japan is over""""? Because remember, Japan ceases to exist anymore, RIGHT PEOPLE?!?!?! WRONG! Wrong, Wrong, WRONG! 

 Petition: The actions of 4Kids has caused many Sonic fans and anime fans alike to rant against them on YouTube. 

 OSK: Well, duh, because 4Kids horribly dubs animes for kids. Ironically, most of those weren't meant to be watched by kids IN THE GODDAMN FIRST PLACE! And on a side note, 4Kids is single-handedly responsible for the start of the Sonic Wars on YouTube, because of that crappy Sonic VA, Jason Griffith! But the next part of the petition really got my blood boiling. 

 Petition: However, in February 2008, several users had their rants removed by 4Kids for """"copyright infringement"""", despite the fact that they did not contain any 4Kids content. Later, in March, one user named RavenCrow89 was banned by 4Kids. RavenCrow had spent nearly 2 years working to get where he was, and 4Kids took it away from him in an instant. His friends have announced that he is never going to return to YouTube. 

 OSK: COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT? WTF IS WRONG WITH 4KIDS?! They don't even HAVE their copyrights in their videos, and because of this, RavenCrow89 was banned?! Al Kahn claims to be all about America, but he doesn't even know about the first Amendment, """"Freedom of Speech"""", which one must really KNOW, if they're going to live in the U.S! And they probably did the same thing to yozukidrive on YouTube! NOW HOW AM I GOING TO WATCH THE JAPANESE VERSION OF SONIC X?! 

 First of all, I would like to thank 4Kids for their crappy piece of anime-dubbing, because for some reason, 4Kids always buy out franchises, in which they don't know 
 WHEN 
 TO 
 LEAVE 
 SHIT 
 ALONE. 

 EVER!!! 

 So in closing, I'm supporting the petition below to put 4Kids on ice before they get their hands on anything else, because they've already corrupted KidsWB! by turning it into the CW4Kids, and let me tell you right now, it's not a good thing, because the last kids station of the '90s is now gone. We should also throw Al Kahn in the slammer for breaking the laws of the constitution. He banned RavenCrow89 from Youtube because he was simply using his right to free speech! Maybe it's because he just can't take criticism or a flame, so he did all of this to innocent people. 

 Finally, 4Kids, stop trashing Japanese anime, and Al Kahn, GO FUCK YOURSELF, YOU RACIST, EVIL, BASTARD!!!

 == Concerning NPOV == 

 That an article named """"Criticism of [whatever]"""" deals mainly with negative 
 issues is natural; further, that even criticisms that are not unopposed are 
 included is right and proper. 

 Still, I see several weaknesses with this particular article, two explicitly 
 discussed below. I note, in particular, that it is proper to present views 
 opposing the criticisms (at least with one sentence statements and 
 links/references for further reading), and in controversial topics and matters 
 of taste, like e.g.  Linux vs. Windows, there will be an opposing view to 
 almost everything. 

  Further, Linux has been accused of being """"not ideal"""" for intermediate power 
  users. 

 This statement is highly odd to me, because criticism is usually directed based 
 on beginners and intermediate users (not """"intermediate power users""""). I 
 have checked the three references: Two seem irrelevant, and only """"Living ..."""" 
 seems relevant to the sentences in question. I have removed the two irrelevant 
 references and the misleading word """"power"""". 

  Linux had been broadly criticized in the past for its lack of support for 
  hardware devices. 

 While it is technically true that Linux has been critized for 
 lacking hardware support, this statement is highly misleading. Looking at the 
 operating systems themselves, Linux is actually ahead of most others, including 
 Windows. The hitch is that hardware developers fail to provide necessary 
 drivers to Linux, because they consider the net-benefit to small (or even 
 negative). Windows, due to its market share, does not have this problem. 
 I have rephrased this section to indicate that hardware developers do not 
 support Linux sufficiently, rather than the other way around. (Note that, while 
 the end effect for a low-end user is the same, this is highly pertinent when 
 doing a factually correct critique or comparison.)

 Please Please Help! I want my music back!  

 I would really appreciate help on this, and I'll do what I can to repay you if your advice helps. 
 A friend borrowed my iPod (video), and it somehow crashed. Now it doesn't show up my songs any more, and even in the settings menu, it says I have zero songs. 
 However if I plug it into my computer and check the Ipod_Control folder there are still many song files there (in e.g. F21 folders and named e.g. YXCG.mp3). How do I get it so I can play them on my iPod? I spent ages giving all my songs ratings and putting them into playlists, so is there a way I can get that back as well? I figure it might have something to do with importing a song list or whatever stored on my ipod. 
 So to clarify, I can look at the music files by browsing through the iPod as a hard drive, but when I want to listen to music on my iPod it isn't there. 
 Please mail me  
 Cheers 

 P.S. I know I shouldn't place this right here, but I really am frustrated and desperate for help... -(

 ==Frequent Pausing bit under Common Critcisms== 
 Okay, who keeps deleting my brief description of the iPod minis' frequent pausing problem?  I had a major problem with this when I had my iPod mini and I'd really like to share this with everybody. 
 : It's me. Because it's not regarded as common and only applies to the mini which is discontinued. You say that the headphone contacts are """"substandard"""", but according to who? It's best if you have sources. Consider adding it as a brief sentence to the iPod mini article. And sign your discussion comments please.   

 According to who?  Numerous internet articles I've found, plus I heard it directly from a technician when I went to the """"Genius Bar"""" at the Apple Store in Denver, CO.  Okay, so the mini is discontinued, but for people who bought a brand new iPod mini the month before it was discontinued (like me,) many people still have them and use them.  What gives you credentials/authority over me to delete what I put on there?  Are you any more of an encyclopedia author than myself? 

 I'll take your suggestion that I should put it in the iPod mini article, but if you think it's just going to be a """"brief sentence"""" you are sorely mistaken.   

 While this issue has also been experienced for some, it is not always a """"common"""" issue. I own a mini as well as a 5G (the mini which my significant other now uses), neither have the described issue. If a comment about this is going to be added to the mini article, please keep it to a neutral opinion and more of a factual basis and not a long described paragraph. And the headphone contacts? I have not had any issues about this either.   

 ==Timezone issue== 
 About the recent addition.  Are there any sources on this aside from forum posting?  Does anyone know if it is all timezones that involve the addition of a half hour?  For example is French Polynesia affected as well?    

 Pick up any iPod with a screen and scan the list of timezones under Settings -> Date & Time -> Set Time Zone.  
 I've done the work as follows. Each timezone has a corresponding DST setting. 

 ===Included=== 
 Eniwetok (+12)* 
 Midway (-11) 
 Hawaii (-10) 
 Alaska (-9) 
 US Pacific (-8) 
 US Mountain (-7) 
 US Central (-6) 
 US Eastern (-5)

 Karachi (+5) 
 Almaty (+6) 
 Bangkok (+7) 
 Beijing (+8) 
 Tokyo (+9) 
 Brisbane (+10) 
 Magadan (+11) 
 Auckland (+12) 

 * In the order they include it, it seems likely they may have accidentally misdefined it as -12 - this may or may not matter. 

 ===Missing=== 

 I've deduced all of the missing timezones from the relevant list on Wikipedia:

5f5a751269b59af8,"Let me clarify, Ndickinson1, about helping WP readers.  The idea is that many tens of thousands of readers will be reading your Peer Marriage article, which makes a big multiplier effect.  Say that a pinpoint citation (pincite) saves each of them even just 1 minute – multiplying this by 10,000 yields a savings of more than 100 hours just due to that one item of careful work you did, multiplying your work by many times.  

 In addition, you apparently need to apply the golden rule to your readers, by imagining yourself in their position as they read this article in its present form, with a poor job of handling the source references (sorry to say that, I know it’s not pleasant for you to hear).  For example, if you had looked at your first two references from the viewpoint of the readers, you would have concluded that your readers needed some help to tell where each source ended and another began, within each group of sources.  Thus you might have numbered the sources in bold, such as: 

 (Imaginary) Group footnote: 1. First source. 2. Next source. 3. Next....  

 Also you couldn’t help noticing that readers would have trouble with the ISBN for the John Badalament book; you would then have helped the readers by looking at your editing for that source reference and would have seen that WP somehow managed to give you a message (if I recall correctly, WP said the last digit of your ISBN number did not agree with its calculated value) and you would have gone back to the book itself to check whether you had entered the correct ISBN number.  So it is clear you did not work hard enough to help the readers.  Being a good WP author is more than just creating a great article and then enjoying how well-written it is.  Namely, it also includes putting in all the pincites the readers will need and doing everything else you can think of to make it easy-as-possible for the readers.  As you can see, my standards go beyond just following the rules, such as Ebikeguy insists that you do (and I agree with him, on behalf of all WP readers).  I want you to also help the readers in every way as much as you possibly can, yielding an even-more-useful article. 

 After all, isn’t that your goal in writing the WP article at all?  

 Hopefully, on behalf of WP readers,"

ea9e6640d484b9be,"""Note that Savonarola was opposed by Taverns and Gambling Houses.  In order to shut him up, they opened their doors to rioters, and literally sucked Savonarola's audience away from him into debauchery.  That is to say, Taverns and Gambling Houses SEDUCED Italians away from Savonarola, much like the serpent sedducing man in Genesis 3.  Today, we notice that modern day Taverns and Gambling Houses  ie, Casinos  are SEDUCING hearts and minds away from Belief in YHWH.  What's that?  You don't Believe YHWH exists?  Well, you've spent more money in Las Vegas than on religious books, right?  See?  You just proved my point.  Who owns Casinos?  The Mafia.  What are mobsters?  Catholics  who Satanically burn the pictures of saints and are cut from the same cloth as the Borgias and Medicis and Jesuits (what do you think the meaning of Francis Xavier holding a """"skull"""", ie, a """"golgotha"""" where the attempted MURDER of the MESSIAH occurred??), who all opposed/oppose Savonarola and his Canonization.  Thus we see that the same dark forces that corrupted the church 500 years ago are still undermining the West today.  Say this, say that, say the other.  I claim I know how your roullette wheel spins.  Money down, here a some predictions which you will NEVER EVER EVER see violated.  First, as the annual gross revenue of the Casino industry increases, so too will the annual gross revenue of the CIA, as well as that of the Homosexual Lobby.  The number of homosexuals in America, and the volume of traffic in San Francisco's gay nightclubs will also increase.  Next, no Jesuit, Mobster, or Company Man will ever, in the history of mankind, from now to forevermore, set foot on Mars.  Notice I did not say they care, I just said they won't do it, ever.  Third, as the annual gross revenue of the Casino industry (and those other industries correlated with it in lock step) increases, mankind's ability to put payloads beyond Earth's gravity well will decrease.  In short, as the Mafia/CIA/Jesuit orders become larger, mankind will become more effeminate, less vigorous, and more queer/gay/homosexual.  If you have access to the statistics and do the analysis yourself, you will see these predictions come true.  WATCH.  Oh yeah, one more thing: no Mobster/Company Man/Jesuit will ever earnestly say, """"Cartago Delende Este"""", nor will they ever spend any money eulogizing the Roman Republic.  Notice, there is a difference between the Republic and the Empire.  The """"Sopranos"""" crowd at HBO makes shows called """"Rome""""  but they are about the empire phase of Roman history, see??  No Mobster will ever ever ever say nice things about, or do nice things for (like erecting statues etc) either Marcus Furius Camullus (who liked iron more than gold, what a dumb-f### right?) or Cincinnatus.  Instead, Mobsters will always prefer Aeneas, and insofar as the Roman Republic created wealth that was stolen by thieving Etruscan pirates, the Mafia will always act way more like Etruscans than Romans.  And no Mobster will ever live to see the rebirth of the Might of Rome.  No mobster will ever see the legions marching under the banners of SPQR.  You say I'm full of it.  But what is the closest'' Italy has come to that recently?  Mussolini.  And the Mafia helped overthrow his regime.  It's not my fault you don't understand.  You will never see any of my predictions fall to the ground. No, actually, you will not.

340ff36454c8d71a,"Wii Mini: why have a separate article? 
 i see that some users disagree with the Wii Mini article, believing it should be merged with the main Wii article.  Here are the reasons why i believe the Wii Mini should get its own article: 
 * Different by design: the Family Edition of the Wii is too similar to the original for a separate article.  The Wii Mini, however, differs in many ways.  The red border covering three sides features no ports, buttons or lights.  The top has the disc tray, power button/LED and eject button, reminiscent of (but incompatible with) the GameCube.  The back has ports.  The Wii Mini deserves its own article for the same reason the Nintendo DS Lite (and, while we're at it, the various minor [[Game Boy line] revisions such as the Pocket, Advance SP and Micro) has its own: it is a different design compared to the original and Family Wii. 
 * Features: the Wii Mini focuses on its core aspect of playing Wii games.  This means that all older games, from the NES to the GameCube, are currently incompatible with the Wii Mini.  One could consider the SD card, but it is unclear if the Wii Mini supports this, or if Virtual Console games could be transferred to or sold for the Wii Mini this way.  Online game support is also omitted, and Internet-dependant applications such as Opera or Netflix cannot be used on the Wii Mini.  However, parents and guardians (such as daycares or hospitals) may be more to know that their children cannot access inappropriate online content on the Wii Mini.  The Wii Mini deserves its own article due to its lack of features and the potential benefit of no Internet access. 
 * Homebrew community: given the lack of features, it may be difficult or impossible to run unauthorized software on the Wii Mini.  Its lack of Internet capabilities could also make it more unattractive for custom applications.  Its lower price point and potential lack of firmware updates, however, may be an appealing motivation.  The Wii Mini deserves its own article because the homebrew community may approach it differently than other Wii consoles. 
 * Canadian exclusive: it is rare that a product is exclusive to Canada.  The majority of the time, a product is launched in markets other than Canada, especially with technology products.  The Wii Mini deserves its own article because, for the time being, Nintendo has made it exclusive to Canada.

 ==Oxford university people categories== 

 I shall post this on the general Oxford Project page, but since you had taken an interest in the Regent's Park College categories I thought you might have the inclination and expertise to deal with it. 

 It keeps coming to my attention that there are a number of categories that aren't quite right. First, Christ Church has a category """"Fellows of Christ Church, Oxford"""". I think this should be replaced with two categories, """"Students of Christ Church, Oxford"""" and """"Canons of Christ Church, Oxford"""". Secondly, I am wondering about Heads of Houses. They seem to be put in the category, """"Fellows of X College, Oxford"""", but are they Fellows? The Warden of All Souls is definitely not a Fellow. I don't think that the other Heads of Houses are Fellows of their colleges. Shall we have forty-seven new categories, """"Warden of All Souls College, Oxford"""", """"Masters of Balliol College, Oxford"""", etc? Perhaps there could be a general category, """"Heads of Houses in the University of Oxford"""". Thirdly, Lecturers (etc). Is it worth having categories for members of college staff who do not hold a fellowship? One argument against the idea is that Lecturer (or similar) is usually a position held by somebody quite junior, while people who have an article about them are probably important enough to have a fellowship. On the other hand, it might be nice to have a way of recording the junior posts that somebody held on the way up to the top; e.g. Anthony Kenny, sometime Lecturer of Exeter and Trinity Colleges. Finally, is it worth distinguishing between Fellows and Honorary Fellows? """

Abaddon is a name that is a judgement given by God down upon the Devil against the Devil because the Devil had many times committed the heretical and blasphemous crime of making the Devil appear as if the Devil was/is/will be God. Whereas the name Apollyon is a judgement given by God down upon the Devil against the Devil because the Devil had many times committed the heretical and blasphemous crime of making the Devil appear as if the Devil was/is/will be Jesus Christ.

 ::Subsequent research 

 My version: 
 :History 
 ::Early research 
 ::Fleischmann–Pons experiment 
 ::Subsequent research 
 I prefer the second version of the headers, because they are briefer and more aesthetic. The second version of the headers convey the exact same information as the first; however, the second version also has brevity and internal symmetry. Little details are important in making a great article, for example, n-dashes instead of hyphens, correct placement of images, simple wording, non-repetitiveness etc. In this case, the second version of the headers have a nice internal symmetry—the """"Early research"""" header reflects off the """"Fleischmein–Pons experiment"""" and gives the symmetric """"Subsequent research"""". The other version of the headers, unfortunately, appears to the reader as clumsy and wordy. And wordiness is something that this article definitely needs to cut down on. That is why the removal of a repetitive sentence in the above discussion was good. More is not better. If something is being repeated or overly wordy, it should be pared down.   """

 Who the hell marked up as needing a citation the comment about the League cup being less prestigious than the FA cup?  Whilst it may well be hard to find citable evidence to prove it, anyone who knows anything about football knows this is the case.   

 The FA Cup is the oldest cup competition in the world, not just England, it was in years gone by the FA Cup Final was the ONLY football match in the season to be televised in this country.  It was and still is viewed around the world in numerous countries by millions of people - is anyone seriously going to try and claim that the same rich history and tradition can be applied to the League cup?  One only needs to look at the reserve sides full of non first team regulars that are put into the competition by all of the big clubs to see this is the case.  It is one of the main domestic trophies in England, but to suggest it's anything but a sideshow when compared to the FA cup is incredibly naive, stupid, or possibly both. 

 I know that wikipedia has strict guidelines, but I challenge anyone to find any football fan who is not aware of the fact that the profile of the League Cup is completely and utterly dwarfed by that of the FA Cup.

 *Support move to Gediminas.  Although Gediminas is a somewhat common male first name among Lithuanians, the name Gediminas is only used by Lithuanians.  Any present or future Gediminas would have a surname which would be included in an article title.  The subject of this article, Didysis Kunigaikštis Gediminas, is the most important and probably only Gediminas without a surname likely to have his own first name only encyclopedia article.  Therefore, I conclude an article title """"Gediminas"""" would have no ambiguity.  More common internationally used king's names such as Henry were used in a number of different countries such as England, Germany, and Sweden.  Therefore, for many of these other monarch's names, it is necessary to specify what country they are from; hence an article would be titled Henry I of England to specify which Henry the article is about, especially since surnames were usually not used for monarchs until later in history.  This is not necessary for Gediminas.   """

cc7598253038bab5,"==Animals' use of LANGUAGE== 
  has insisted on repeatedly adding statements that animals such as apes, horses, and dogs use language. Below are comments from her talk page for others to read and respond: 

  
 I mean no personal offense, but it is clear that you know little or nothing about the linguistics of sign language. Sign language, like any other language, consists of signs, grammatical rules, and syntax. It's not just a conglomeration of gestures that we call signs. Animals do NOT use language, regardless of what a source might say. To say that animals use sign language is equivalent to saying that if I learn 10 words in a foreign language that I can speak that language. Adding a source to something that is wrong does not mean that it should stay in the article. If I add a source to Moon stating that it is made of cheese, that doesn't mean it is correct and should remain in the article. Please familiarize yourself with the linguistics of sign language (start by reading every article related to American Sign Language) before adding outrageous information about animals using sign language. I have used American Sign Language for 30 years and I still don't consider myself fluent in it. I also have read the research on attempts to teach signs to animals (not grammar, not syntax, just SIGNS). To state that an animal that responds to a few signs is using language is absurd. If you can find two or three peer-reviewed articles in a journal on lingusitics claiming definitively that animals use language, I will stand corrected. Again, no personal offense, but reliable sources are necessary for editing, but alone they are not necessarily sufficient. I would never edit an article on nuclear physics just because I read an article on the internet about the topic; some articles require more than a source or two to edit properly; they require competence in the subject matter.    

 Do you know the first language babies can learn? sign language. They are not able to use proper grammar rules and syntax, but they are able to communicate using sign language. the same goes for gorillas and chimps. additionally humans use sign language to communicate with dogs and horses. i don't see what the problem is.-jessica 
 :I'm not talking about babies. Of course babies can learn sign language; children of deaf adults do it every day. I'm talking about animals such as chimps and gorillas, who do not use language. Communication is not the same thing as language. Please read about language. Language is more than words or signs. For the third time: LANGUAGE HAS RULES. Gorillas, chimps, dogs, and horses DO NOT USE THE RULES OF LANGUAGE. At most they use or respond to words or signs. If I point to something that I want, I AM NOT USING LANGUAGE. I am using gestures. Stop edit warring on this matter because every linguist in the world disagrees with you."

 Re: """"Deriving the pitches in a pentatonic scale from stacked fifths leads to a Pythagorean scale of {1/1, 9/8, 81/64, 3/2, 27/16}. Deriving the pitches from the major scale leads to a just scale of either {1/1, 9/8, 5/4, 3/2, 5/3} (a 5-limit pentatonic) or {1/1, 9/8, 21/16, 3/2, 7/4} with blue notes of the flatted fifth and flatted seventh."""":  

 First: A Pythagorean diatonic scale is (a tuning of) a major scale. In fact, it’s the only major scale tuning advocated consistently by music theorists for two thousand years, in very round numbers, from 500 B.C. until 1500 A.D., when it began to be supplanted by the just scale.  

 Second: The term “5-limit’’ is a microtonal-fringe neologism. We can properly speak of just intervals, which diverge from Pythagorean intervals by a syntonic comma, approximately 21.5 cents, or a diatonic just scale, which is derived by stacking 4:5:6 major triads thus: F A C, C E G, G B D, and that’s it.  

 Re: """"The blues scale can be tuned {1/1, 7/6, 4/3, 7/5, 3/2, 7/4}."""": 

 Blues notes are alternate inflections, which means they do not generally correspond to specific frequency proportions, but are subject to all sorts of expressive “deviations”. There is some justification for the “7/4” flatted seventh because trumpet players tend to play this blues note with the seventh harmonic, but as a whole this tuning is merely theoretical speculation.

 ** There's nothing misleading about it, and the article's analysis is superficial at best. The Acela is at the low end of high-speed, but it's still high-speed by the definition that matters. The Northeast Regional is not high-speed and is no more relevant to this discussion than any of the slower IC trains on the Berlin-Hamburg route. The Wired article isn't particularly rigorous and probably shouldn't be used as a source at all. It doesn't tell us which dates it booked for, nor which fare brackets, nor which class. I have done similar test bookings for American and German city-pairs and come up with different results. Nor does it indicate whether the German fare included a seat reservation (which is included on the Acela). Using New York-Baltimore means including the rather slow North River Tunnels; I'm not aware of a comparable feature on the Berlin-Hamburg route. The German train is also non-stop, while the Acela is not. I imagine that's because, as the article said, there's a whole lot of nothing between those two cities. If the writer had traveled in the Ruhr, he would have found conditions comparable to the Northeast Corridor. In any event, this is all beside the point. Nothing in that article contradicts the article's assertion that the Acela is high-speed rail, operational differences between the US and the rest of the world notwithstanding."

 A list of books about the historical name of the church surely has little relevance to an article about an extant church?  

 And indeed, some histories use """"Audeon"""". In the 18th century (1717) Nicholas Forster writes about a """"Sermon preached in the Parish-Church of St Audeon, Dublin""""; in 1906 Frederick Falkiner KC's """"The Foundation of the Hospital and Free School of King Charles II"""" uses """"Audeon""""; and in 1913 the Parish Register Society of Dublin published a record of marriage entries from the parish registers of """"St Andrew, St Anne, St Audeon and St Bride"""". As to the Bishop of Canea's Histories, I think he uses """"Audeon"""", contrary to what you have said. Further, the church is known among Dubliners as """"Audeon's"""". 

 I'm not going to insist on the use of """"Audeon"""" in the place of """"Audoen"""", but I think it would be worth while at least noting at the start of the article that the alternative usage exists.

 With regards to """"but it has carbon loaded glue; that makes little sense except for stealth"""" - simply put nothing could be farther from the truth.  

 When the 229 was under construction there was a dire lack of resin wood glues to work with, since pretty much all the factories producing resin were no longer in operation. So what were the Hortons to do? Adding charcoal to wood glue is a very old, simple and cheap method of improving the strength of wood glue. I believe this is the primary, if not sole reason for the presence of carbon in the wood glue. 

 And to add to that simply adding charcoal to glue is not going to magically give you reduced RCS properties. The RAM materials used on stealth aircraft do have carbon in them, but it is far more complex then simply tossing some in to the mix. The size of the carbon """"pellets"""" are carefully selected and applied to the skin in a way that ensures an equal, grid like distribution. This is far beyond just adding charcoal to the glue. 

 As far as Myrhas claims that the aircraft was designed for stealth, keep in mind that this is based on interviews he conducted with the Horton brothers after the B-2 became known publicly. In the years after WW2 the Horton brothers published several books, and not a single one of them made any mention of stealth in the design of the 229 or any other aircraft designed by them. Until the B-2 came out of the black that is - then they released a new edition of an earlier book with mentions of stealth and the addition of coal to the glue as an attempt at making RAM. Furthermore interviews with other engineers at Horten after turn up zero mentions of stealth. And one interview with an engineer in the 90s, when asked about the stealthy aspects of the 229, stated rather emphatically that there was no attempt at stealth with the 229.

ISBN-13 on the other hand was devised to be compatible with the EAN-13 barcode (which recognises ten unique symbols, with no provision for the letter X), and consequently uses the same check digit calculation as is used to produce the barcode on your cornflakes box.

54a33dd029a3c2f8,"== MSU Interview == 

 Dear Fram, 

  
 My name is Jonathan Obar , I'm a professor in the College of Communication Arts and Sciences at Michigan State University and a Teaching Fellow with the Wikimedia Foundation's Education Program. This semester I've been running a little experiment at MSU, a class where we teach students about becoming Wikipedia administrators. Not a lot is known about your community,  and our students (who are fascinated by wiki-culture by the way!) want to learn how you do what you do, and why you do it. A while back I proposed this idea (the class) to the community HERE, were it was met mainly with positive feedback. Anyhow, I'd like my students to speak with a few administrators to get a sense of admin experiences, training, motivations, likes, dislikes, etc. We were wondering if you'd be interested in speaking with one of our students. 

  
 So a few things about the interviews: 
 * Interviews will last between 15 and 30 minutes. 
 * Interviews can be conducted over skype (preferred), IRC or email. (You choose the form of communication based upon your comfort level, time, etc.) 
 * All interviews will be completely anonymous, meaning that you (real name and/or pseudonym) will never be identified in any of our materials, unless you give the interviewer permission to do so. 
 * All interviews will be completely voluntary. You are under no obligation to say yes to an interview, and can say no and stop or leave the interview at any time. 
 * The entire interview process is being overseen by MSU's institutional review board (ethics review). This means that all questions have been approved by the university and all students have been trained how to conduct interviews ethically and properly. 

  
 Bottom line is that we really need your help, and would really appreciate the opportunity to speak with you. If interested, please send me an email at obar@msu.edu (to maintain anonymity) and I will add your name to my offline contact list. If you feel comfortable doing so, you can post your name  instead. 

 If you have questions or concerns at any time, feel free to email me at obar@msu.edu. I will be more than happy to speak with you. 

 Thanks in advance for your help. We have a lot to learn from you. 

 Sincerely, 

 Jonathan Obar"

 ===Congressional Black Caucus==== 

 Maybe one of you Wikipedia types could edit the line about the exclusion of menthols being """"influenced by the Congressional Black Caucus"""". Actually, according to the New York Time article here: http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/25/business/25menthol.html the Congressional Black Caucus wanted to ban mentholated cigarettes because of their influence on the African American Community, but others felt amending it would lead to its defeat. As it written now it makes it sound like the Congressional Black Caucus pushed for the exemption, which sounds a bit like a racist joke, IMHO. I'd do it myself but I don't know how to write the references. KTHANX."""

 *Reverting another user's talk page is pretty rude.  There is a policy conflict between the user talk page policy, which says users can blank or archive warnings (although archiving is preferred by the community) and the vandalism policy, which says that removing warnings given to you is vandalism.  I don't agree with the vandalism point of view, and I haven't seen a lot of support for it lately except among people who are fighting amongst themselves for other reasons.  If someone deletes a warning they've obviously seen it.  If you are concerned about someone's edits, use a verbose edit summary so that even if the warning is removed the edit summary will be visible. 
 *I understand there is a view among two of you that Mrpainkiller7's edits are detrimental to the article.  There are lots of right ways to deal with this, including editing by consensus, Request for comment on the article or the user, Mediation, and third opinion.  I'm not going to judge the content, but fighting (wherever it occurs) is the wrong way to deal with the problem. 
 *Personal attacks are not to be tolerated.  Please deal with the content of edits, not character.

c934af2d2f9bc79c,""":I'm fine with """"Celtic"""" culture not being monolithic, but if the roundhouse culture was across Britain, all of it should be included or none. To me it make more sense to think of the Celts as being loosely linked with distinctive local variations. The areas left white later became Norse territory, but up to the time of the Picts the archaeology indicates a shared culture with more southerly areas. Similarly, the Pictish language is unknown, but their territory included much more of Scotland, down near to the Forth and Clyde. Many scholars seem to think they had a Brythonic Celtic language, perhaps differing from the Brythonic spoken in Scotland south of the Pictish territory...it's an interestingly untidy period...  

 This is anything but scientific... but common French imagery about Gaul has their house round rather than rectangular. We associate the rectangular shape more commonly with the Germanic or Norse style of building. (then again, Celts ang Vikings may have had more in common than many usually guess)  

 == Pronunciation again == 

 I removed this sentence: 

 :Becuase it is not an Enlish invented word, a pronunciation with /s/ should not be accepted. 

 Aside from its spelling errors, this sentence is prescriptivist. Wikipedia doesn't tell people what to do. Furthermore, the conclusion does not follow the premise. We use words and names all the time that are from foreign languages but are pronounced like English words. For example, we pronounce """"wiener"""" as """"weener"""", not """"veener"""". We say """"Seezer"""" instead of """"Kay-sahr"""" for Caesar. In fact, very few words are """"English-invented"""", and a great many words we used are neither spelled nor pronounced the way they originally were. What makes """"Celt"""" so different? Personally, I think both pronunciations are valid. It's a POV issue, so Wikipedia has no business stating one way or the other. -    

 :: From a language point of view, both pronunciations *are* valid... in English. c as an initial consonant with /s/ sound has precedent in the English language. The /k/ sound at the beginning of 'Celt' comes from the original Greek, and this pronunciation was notably revived along with the romantic revival of 'Celticity' beginning in the 18th century in western Europe, then continuing on to the present.  

 :: So, the Boston folk are saying it correctly, but in a particular context. The descriptivist way of looking at this problem is that both are valid, but the two pronunciations are begining to be 'appropriate' according to context: /k/ when referring to 'Celtic' peoples/languages/nations, /s/ when referring to the sports teams on both sides of the Atlantic, and so on. Being on the side of the prescriptivists myself, this makes my teeth grind a bit, but such is life. )   

  
 ::: I too am a prescriptivist, and support the soft C sound, again because of _our_ origin of the word.  The ultimate origin notwithstanding, we got our word from the French language.  Historically, the /k/ pronunciation was only countenanced when actually spelling the word with a /k/.   

 ::: I understand that language evolves over time, but the short time this has been common does not lend sufficient weight to it as a 'proper' pronunciation.  I'm considering mentally modifying it to a permanent /k/ spelling so I can stop people from 'correcting' me in day to day speech.  (See: The Big Book of Beastly Mispronunciations, Charles Herrington Elster).

 ===Ultramar Sur=== 

 In 2002 the book Ultramar Sur: La Fuga En Submarinos De Mas De 50 Jerarcas Nazis (roughly, """"Overseas South: The Flight by Submarine of more than 50 Ranking Nazis"""") by Carlos de Nápoli and Juan Salinas provided further information on U-530s voyage to Argentina, allegedly based on photocopies of the declassified interrogation of Oberleutnant Otto Wermuth which was held at Mar del Plata between 13 and 15 July 1945. 

 Upon entering Mar del Plata submarine base on 10 July 1945, U-530 had a """"calamitous aspect"""". The hull was rusting, the conning tower was splitting apart and the corroded casing bore traces of a recent serious fire. A determined attempt had been made to sabotage the diesels. The commander, described as tall and blond in newspaper reports, identified himself as Otto Wermuth. The commander and most of his crew were unable to produce identity documents. The commander told reporters that U-530 sailed from Horten, Norway on 3 March 1945 and observed radio silence as from 24 April when entering US coastal waters. He described having been very close to New York City, and saw trains and automobiles through the periscope. Allegedly the boat had no further radio contact with anybody until 12 May, when the crew finally learned of Germany's surrender the previous week. 

 The Argentine Navy investigators were of the opinion that there had been a mutiny aboard U-530, and that Oberleutnant Otto Wermuth had not always been in command of the boat. Since none of the logs or war diary had been retained, the actual details of the voyage remain unknown. Otto Wermuth was short and dark-haired, and it was therefore suspected that the tall, blond Otto Wermuth who sailed the boat into Mar del Plata was an impostor who had come aboard very recently, probably from some place on the Argentine coast. To support this theory it may be noted that he was vague as to details of the voyage and stated that """"the deck gun was unshipped in Germany and left on the quayside"""" while the crew all remember having manhandled it overboard into the Atlantic. Type IXC/40 boats like U-530 had the deck gun deleted from 1943 onwards like most U-boat types. U-530 began her first war patrol on 1 March 1943. 

 From the declassified documents it is not clear which Otto Wermuth underwent the naval interrogation on 13 July 1945. The officer refused to answer most questions, except to state that he had been given a """"mission of reconnaissance and attack directly from Berlin"""". He had decided to head for Argentina when """"1000 miles north east of Puerto Rico"""", and crossed the Equator near the St. Peter and Paul Rocks. To avoid the coastal patrols he sailed 200 miles offshore. He arrived at Punta Mogotes light, Mar del Plata, at 0300 on 9 July 1945, and then went down the coast to Miramar, where he arrived at 0600 and spent the day there. He returned to Mar del Plata at 0700 on 10 July 1945. He was unable to explain the absence of one of the U-boat's six inflatable dinghies. He admitted to having jettisoned overboard all the torpedoes bar one dud, all the hand weapons, light machine guns and all the ammunition, the radars and Metox and the pressure gauges. He also destroyed all the books, diaries, charts, 53 code books and other books of """"a secret character"""". Nearly all the crew arrived without identity documents, and so it was impossible to know who was who.

Many of their current best sellers include """"Destruction Camp"""", """"The Fear You Will Not Know"""", and """"Insane Reach for the Normality we Can't Have"""".  A large portion of the lyrics of their songs are inspired by both Metallica references that Perkins provided, and sad instances of life which Stefan has drawn inspiration from.  During a recent interview of the band Proulx and Stefan both stated that the true talent came from Perkins, Zick, and absolute dedication from Stillian.  Stillian stated that during the inception of the band that he could not sing, but really thought it would be cool to be a lead singer for a band.  All members agreed and allowed him into the band.  The first song written by the band is titled """"Your Words Cut Like Broken Glass on Baby Skin""""  which was inspired by a conglomeration idea that relationships are more harmful that they are helpful.

 Let's stop this stupid nonsense of 'BCE' and 'CE'.  The terms BC and AD are quite in order and amply adequate.  Interestingly enough, BCE can stand for Before the Christian Era and CE for [pertaining to] the Christian Era.  Another example where political correctness shoots itself in the foot.  I encourage all readers to edit out BCE and CE wherever they are found.

 ::, I read the section you mentioned. Neither the CDC, UCR, or NCVS definitions are the legal definition of rape. Each study used its own definition, which is typical of studies and surveys. The actual definition varies on the state or the country, as noted in the International Law. Given that no other page on sexual violence limits the discussion of the topic based on the legal definition, I fail to see this page should be the exception.  

 ::The previous version misrepresented the findings of the CDC study by obscuring the rates of female-perpetrated sexual violence men reported. Given that the rest of the section refers to """"sexual victimization,"""" """"sexual abuse,"""" and """"sexual encounters,"""" I see no reason not to mention the other findings. None of the other sections on this page, or any other sexual violence page, limits what statistics can be included based on what definition is used by a given study.  

 ::The sections should be written from a neutral point of view, so if person takes issue with acknowledging information because it does not coincide with their personal views, such a person should rethink editing Wikipedia. Various experts are clear that due to under-reporting we cannot be certain of the frequency of female-on-male sexual violence. As a result, it is inaccurate to make any concrete claims about the frequency or rarity of any victims or rapists. It also undermines the intent of this section, which is to inform people about all the findings.   23:16"""
