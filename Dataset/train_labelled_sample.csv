As far as I can tell, learned people don't express their opinions as either """"Vatican II is infallible"""" or """"Vatican II is not infallible"""".  Everyone is pretty much agreed that ecumenical councils exercise their infallibility via the promulgation of dogmatic definitions, so the question really is whether Vatican II promulgated any dogmatic definitions.  Even the famous Pope Paul VI quote that traditional Catholics always cite uses this terminology:
“There are those who ask what authority, what theological qualification, the Council intended to give to its teachings, knowing that it avoided issuing solemn dogmatic definitions backed by the Church's infallible teaching authority. The answer is known by those who remember the conciliar declaration of March 6, 1964, repeated on November 16, 1964. In view of the pastoral nature of the Council, it avoided proclaiming in an extraordinary manner any dogmas carrying the mark of infallibility.” (General Audience, December 1, 1966, published in the L'Osservatore Romano 1/21/1966)

When this arbcom started at 21 January 2010, we were at 52,000 unreferenced BLPs, today we are at 45,000. That is 7,000 articles we as a community have referenced in 17 days, and the pace will only increase as more wikiprojects get involved. I can reference 40 articles in a day, 1/3 of the 124 proposed, this is very doable folks.
I would strongly encouarge you to support this proposal. It is very doable. 
I am actively working to notify other wikiprojects of several tools, see for example:

As User:The-Pope wrote on my talk page:
The WP:Australia project had a list of over 2000 names just over 2 weeks ago. It's now under 900.  900 is still fairly unworkable, so we've split them up again into smaller topics. Other lists have popped up, Cricket, Rugby union, India and probably many more.   This is all do-able, but it does take time, it does get a bit boring, it can be tempting for some editors to put the first google hit they see on it and remove the tag, but it can work.  One other good thing about these lists, is that you can use the related changes link to see all edits to them... great to keep an eye on pages without clogging up your watchlist (almost like having multiple watchlists). 
This is very possible. As an editor who strives to save almost all articles for the past 4 years, and who has fought so many policy argument to keep articles, this is a wonderful comprimise, with so much potential, I would hope that you would seriously consider this proposal.

It seems that either you do not understand, either you are of bad faith. Let's make it simple:

According to Encyclopaedia Judaica (Jerusalem, 1972), not I, the great argument of the Reform rabbis in Frankfurt (1843) was """"God ordered circumcision to Abraham, not to Moses""""; in other words God's COMMANDMENT to Abraham is circumcision, God's COMMANDMENTS to Moses do not order circumcision; in other words:

- God's One Commandment to Abraham = circumcision.

- God's Ten Commandments to Moses = not even one for circumcision!

The rabbis, not I said so! Therefore, wholly and seriously documented, I wrote it into the main article but WP and S rub it out. This is an insane violation of the wiki rules.

Now, in order to enlighten the main article, the 2nd Commandment topic of this """"Discussion""""  introduces my """"discovery"""" (a child would do it). It says:

- God's 2nd Commandment to Moses orders him: """"Do not circumcise.""""

But, contrary to the saying of PW and S, I never attributed this to the Reform rabbis.

Conclusion: who forgot to take their medicine, for several days now? Not I!

The ethical question involved about this discussion is: """"How can the wiki support a very obviously childish lie just because this lie has been carried along for millennia?"""" Think about it! If you are responsible persons, you cannot publish an obvious lie without warning your readers, which I am doing.

Sigi's request to WP and S: """"Circumcise your heart, eyes, ears and pen, not your peco!"""" because yes, this criminal violation of Moses 2nd Commandment is being done every day in the USA to baby boys. It even has been done to an Oregon girl, in 1950 (see http://www.aesculapiuspress.com/ - Books – The rape of innocence); indeed a good American mother cannot want her beloved daughter be deprived from circumcision when her beloved son gets it, can she?

Wrong licenses
I have corrected the licenses for the majority of the images you have uploaded. The exceptions are:
:Image:Wankhede Mumbai.jpg - On the flickr page the author has apparently agreed to license the image under one of the free Creative Commons licenses, but failed to actually change the licensing. 
:Image:Dhoom2.jpg - Concern that the creator is in no position to submit the image under a Creative Commons license, as it depicts a billboard for a film and copyright to it is held by somebody else than the photographer. As such, the photo may not be used on Wikipedia, except perhaps under fair use policy (which probably doesn't apply), or under panorama freedom (depending on what the copyright law of India says on this topic).
:Image:Bipasha.jpg - Image description page implies that it is licensed for non-commercial use only (contradicting your copyright tag); such a restriction is not acceptable on Wikipedia. In addition, the link to the original source (which could clarify which condition is correct) of the image is missing.
:Image:Bom.jpg - The link to the original source at flickr is missing; author uploads images to flickr as """"all rights reserved"""". 
:Image:Chowpatti.jpg - To verify that the image is indeed under the license you claim, the author should probably e-mail the Wikimedia Foundation and confirm that it is indeed under that license.
:Image:Hydmall.jpg - The flickr page states that it is under a Creative Commons No-Derivative license; a license that prohibits the image to be modified/used in derivative works is not acceptable on Wikipedia, either.
:Image:Infobangalore.jpg - No evidence of the image being under a free license.
:Image:Brigaderoad.jpg - Flickr page states """"all rights reserved"""".
:Image:Hoogly.jpg - The link to the original source at flickr is missing; author uploads images to flickr as """"all rights reserved"""".
:Image:Haf.jpg - Flickr page states """"all rights reserved"""".
:Image:Bangtemp.jpg - Creative Commons No-Derivative license.
:Image:Kolkahomes.jpg - All rights reserved.
:Image:Delhimall.jpg - Creative Commons Attribution Non-commercial No-derivative license (unacceptable on Wikipedia).
:Image:Yamun.jpg - All rights reserved.
:Image:Kolk.jpg - All rights reserved.
:Image:Myspalbang.jpg - All rights reserved.
:Image:Bangalore.jpg - The link to the original source is missing; no evidence that it is under the Creative Commons license.
:Image:Lalbagh.jpg - Taken from WikiTravel. Uploader ought to confirm that he is indeed under the author and that he has licensed it under the license indicated.
:Image:Nagpur.JPG - Who made this image?

There are several issues here. There are multiple Creative Commons licenses, not all of which are acceptable on Wikipedia. In particular, licenses that prohibit commercial use or making of derivative works are considered unfree and can't be used on Wikipedia, except as provided by the fair use policy; Creative Commons Atrribution, and Creative Commons Atrribution Sharealike licenses are okay. Also, there are multiple versions of the licenses; Creative Commons Atrribution Sharealike 1.0, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 are all distinct licenses. (The problem is that the upload dialogue only lists the 3.0 versions and not the earlier ones; when the image is under one of the older licenses, you ought to edit the image description page and correct the number. As far as I can see, Flickr only uses the 2.0 versions of the licenses.)

In addition, some of the Flickr authors have indicated that they allow the image to be used on Wikipedia, without making it clear that they release it under one of the acceptable licenses; a permission that only extends to Wikipedia is not sufficient, either. You should ask the authors to do one of the following:
Change the Flickr page to license the image under Creative Commons Attribution (or Attribution Sharealike) license (apparently, this would change the licensing for all images, and this may not be what they intend to do);
Post a message to the image page with a text similar to the following:
I, creator of the image, agree to license it under the Creative Commons Attribution license (link) [alternately: under the Creative Commons Attribution Sharealike license (link). This declaration overrides any statement to the contrary on this page.
E-mail the Wikimedia Foundation (permissions-en[AT]wikimedia[DOT]org) with a message similar to the above, also specifying which image (images) the user intends to release under the license. (This would be the best choice if the author doesn't want to reveal his identity on Wikip",0,0,0,0,0,0

 I respect your logic behind moving the Khalifman quote from Methods for comparing top chess players throughout history to World Chess Championship 2010. I do however wish to bring your attention back to what was my original intent. I have observed this page frequently. Few years ago, I started wondering as to what is the acceptable time period for this page to remain hostage to the old statistics of Jeff Sonas, Raymond Keene, Nathan Divinsky, Matej Guid and Ivan Bratko. More recently I observed many past players (or their protege) beginning to exploit this page to proclaim greatness. My additions were merely an attempt to coerce a reflection on the """"present state"""" because """"Throughout History"""" seems to have stopped at 2005! The elo list only adds to the confusion because it is inflationary in nature. In my humble opinion, the present cathartic state is a bigger violation of encylopedia guidelines then my attempt to update it. Do remember that Wikipedia is visited by more lay people (who will be seriously mislead/confused by the data upto 2005) then experts (who can objectively transpose it to year 2011). A lot of 10 year old kids use Wikipedia to learn and write their homework. It is fine if we want to wait till someone of great repute explicitly compares current players to Fischer or either of the K's, or someone acceptable comes forth with up-to-date statistics beyond 2005.

I can't even edit using a *verifiable* account without being accused of violating some concocted offense. My address was censored because I was using an account which was apparently improperly named, so I am now using one that IS properly named (AFTER the probation period) and that in and of itself is apparently an offense. Logically, what is going on is that I am being unable to contribute in any way whatsoever because I am being repeatedly punished for a first offense spawned from ignorance. What kind of site are you people trying to run here?!

 It's no wonder the main founder of wikipedia turned his back on it when it's become such a blatant travesty of the intellectual honesty it purports to espouse. I have continuously been censored for editing a biased article- an article which is continuously edited by self-avowed marxists and anti-zionists (the very same people whose POV the article unashamedly puts forward). What kind of encyclopedia has articles that put forward opinion verified by echo chamber sources? If any editor attempted to put that sort of trash in Britannica they would be quickly disassociated with the publication- but it's quite apparent that Wikipedia has no controls whatsoever and has chosen to let the patients run the asylum. There is no use in attempting to run an objective and educational publication when the very people who have discredited the internet as a source of information are allowed to manipulate the site by sourcing the same intellectually dishonest sites that people use wikipedia to avoid. 

In short, explain yourselves- particularly Roland Rance, who has manipulated his position on this site to censor any points he disagrees with- all without explaining why.

I realize that self-incrimination goes against human nature, but we can resolve the discrepancy by taking incrimination out of our definitions.  Terrorism, for instance, doesn't have to be pejorative.  We can talk about it simply as a method of war or influence.  If terrorism isn't evil, then it doesn't matter if Israel includes terrorism as one of its tactics.
You may think that stripping any implication of terrorism from Israel is good for the Jewish people, but let's look at the big picture.  In the information age, we can no longer keep people from researching historical data.  Trying to subvert this information only serves to show the bias of those attempts.  With unrestricted global communication, manipulation of mass communication is passé.  I believe I can make a case for it never having been a good thing, but that is beside the point.

And while I'm temporarily acting grown up, I should add that IMHO, you and Berlet are barking up a very wrong tree with the whole """"coded discourse hidden meanings"""" business, and are unwittingly (hopefully) lending credence to the far more noxious aspects of that enterprise by going off on that tangent. You cannot verify the claims, and as such, yuo will lose that debate, and by virtue of losing, lend credibility to aspects of that organization (as well as it propagandistic persecution complex motifs) far beyond its semiotics. I would stick to the many more obvious creepy things. The gibberish, I'm afraid, is simply gibberish. Intentional? I don't know. But its what it appears to me they love having you focus on.

207884eb482c42a3,"Wade Park 

The whole point is that the park is much more than the museum (it's more than 10% of a square mile), so it's a significantly different entity from the museum itself.  Because there's no article on the HD, we shouldn't have its infobox anywhere at all.  Granted, we shouldn't have a stub for the sole purpose of filling a hole, but we also shouldn't pretend that another article fills that hole either.    

You are partially correct in your assertion made in the edit summary for the Wade Park article - the park isn't the entire district, but you are also partially incorrect. You're saying: The park itself is not the district, and the National Register database indicates that the park isn't even part of the district  where that I underlined is where you're erring.  The NRHP website lists this: Roughly bounded by E. 105 St., East Blvd., Chester and Euclid Aves. , Cleveland'' (650 acres, 7 buildings, 1 structure)'http://nrhp.focus.nps.gov/natregsearchresult.do?fullresult=true&recordid;=339http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/oh/Cuyahoga/districts.html Unless we are looking at different NRHP websites, and you haven't either spent time in Cleveland or ,at the very least, looked at trhe area in question on the map, then you're not taking into account two three things: 1) the 650 acres includes Wade Park (Google Map it). 2) The name Wade Park District explicitly (and even implicitly if you're familiar firsthand with the history of Cleveland). 3) (and this is related to my second point regarding a familiarity with the history of Cleveland) Jeptha Wade's property, which is where Wade Park is and the heart of the district in question, was the seed from where all the buildings in the district sprung from. The CMA, Botanical Gardens, Natural History Museum and Severance Hall, which all are part of the district, would not be there if Wade Park wasn't set aside to be the cultural epicenter that garnered it's NRHP entry.

Lastly, given that any one of the buildings listed on the registry are technically part of the WPHD, there would be no false information by including the NRHP infobox on any of those articles  which was my entire point of putting it on the CMA article in the first place. The infobox being clearly labelled as Wade Park District''' is not misleading by including it on a building that is part of the district. We could argue about this ad nauseam. But what's the point?

Of course I can make an entire article that covers the district specifically. But why just regurgitate the same stuff found in each individual Wikipedia article that exists for every building that is in the HD (including the Wade Park itself)? Bandwdith pollution notwithstanding, it is simply redundant. Or we could make it less redundant by simply putting the infobox in one of the articles already out there... and the Wade Park article being the namesake for the HD would make the most sense (the article is hardly complete, and could be expanded to include an entire section specifically about the HD and relationship bewteen the two)... and if not that article than the CMA which is the largest building in the HD, and the reason I put it there in the first. Either way, the underlying question in this argument that I have for you is this: how is it productive in our task as Wikipedians, and moreover as members of Ohio-specific Wikprojects, to keep adding and removing factual info from articles with direct relationships to the subject of our debate? Are we trying to make Wikpedia a more informative user-based encyclopedia, or are we nitpicking over how to make a piece of factual information, that is an important part of a large US City, available to those who are looking at Wikipedia for information?",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Some more detail about Mormonism and constructions fundaments 

Regarding polygamism with early mormons, Joseph Smith and his first group of 12 mens were using it all the time but hidding it from their wifes... Joseph Smith was married to more than 20 womens, without the knowledge of his wife, and problems occured when this first group around him wished to make this polygamism as an official rule of their sect.

As the first wife of J. Smith was to know about her husbands several wifes, and made a scandal against it and asked for divorce, so angry she was against him, Joseph Smith changed his mind. It made J. Smith to think a little more about the problem and to make it a non legal part of their rules, which made the other male members angry at him. It end up as a polygamism rule, but first fully applied to all after Joseph Smith death. As many things in mormonism they first appeared after the foundators death, and are mostly made by its closest coworkers to assist them in gaining more power. 
It is also very well known that previously to Smiths writings about the supposed contain of its golden books, he was contacted by various members of masonics loges, and many of this church rituals, both sacred and profane, are directly taken from classical freemasonry and masonic orders'rituals. Many of the believes enumerated in the mormons books are also directly taken from those traditions, therefor the mormons books looks more, for a religions and myhtologies and esoterisms specialist point of view, like an amalguame or milk shake of several religious and sectars theories, well known within other religious groups, than a religion in itself. Nothing in the mormon books is original, all is taken from somewhere else, often with quiet a unimaginativ mind.

The mormons researchs in latin america have given zero zero zero as prooves who could elaborate anything stated in the book of mormon as a source, or even ressembling source, for all the tribes described there. 
Another correction to what some have earlier stated here: there is a hell in mormons theory. 
Only true mormon, true knights of the later days saints, and else being it since as most generations as possible, have access to heaven,(the upper part, nearest to God). The downs part being reserved to just coming in members and half fallen members. And out of it is hell, for non mormon, who cannot access the other levels, and will never been able to be in the upper levels. It is clearly stated in the mormons teaching, and I heard it several times, by mormons priests, that there is no salvation for non mormon. Christian go to hell too, and none of the christian priests are recognized as such, nor are they aknowledge the power to baptise anyone, and they teach that even the first apostles, those walking around Jesus Christ, were not able to baptise others and that it is therefor their power was stopped there, until Jesus christ himself took to latin america, and baptised a bunch of by mistake-landed-there-hebrews, and later on this power was given by Christ and Moises itself to Joseph Smith. 
And thats the way the story goes.

The foundator of the christian church is by definition unable to baptise others. Peter was spiritually impotent if we are to believe the mormonic song. 
A way one can undoubtly see the influence of freemasonry in the mormon church is their attribution of 1st and second degree of priesthood, like a copy-paste of hebraic traditions, with some dubious change into it. 
You are missing here also, the place of womens in the mormon church where political reasons, clearly prevail: It is for exemple today teached, that the upper god, is a goddess, the wife of God, and higher than him, and that she cant be named, and very little is known about her because she is OH! so high and special. It is also teached that the reason why women cannot be priest nor teach like priest, nor baptised, is that women are per birth closer to god than men, and that is therefor men only must try to come closer to god by manifesting their spirituality from an early age, all things a woman do not need to do as she has it all to begin with... It is also teach that men must fight harder to attain the same spiritual level as women have, and thats why women must do other things in the mean time: like give birth to more mormons members, do the cleaning and make food, and play missionary 1½ year of their life just before getting married, as soon as they return from mission time. All that good propaganda methods to secure the upcoming of new female members in that order, as well as keeping the youngsters in the old sheme of things, without risking having them asking certain questions, very up to date, very warms, and never answered by this church.

These taglines are not notable. According to the Style guidelines, """"As a general rule don't include taglines in an article. """"Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information"""". However, if a particular tagline was a significant part of the cultural influence of the film, create a section for it and describe its effects."""" It provides an example of this as Jaws 2's tagline, """"Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water..."""" which is indeed a notable tagline. The only taglines that are at all notable aren't notable because they're taglines, they're notable because they're memorable quotes from the movie.

But why does it matter? Because they are unprofessional and unecyclopedic. They make the article """"all listy,"""" which greatly detracts form its quality. This is why it has a clean-up tag. (As a side note, moving the lists to the bottom doesn't really help the problem at all.)  

I am un-willing to use your opinion as to what is notable and here is why. You are forgetting the historic refereance to the example you gave. """"A different set of Jaws"""". I am returning the deleted section. Should Wiki Admin weigh in on this, I will do what they decide. Just coming around and saying something is not this or is that, does not make it true. I ask that you provide a basis to your belief that the Taglines from Rocky Horror are not notable or are you just not familier with the film?. 
 If the taglines are culturally significant they will be quoted in a published source. I'm removing them again, per WP:REF. If you chose to re-add them, please provide citations.  

I'm sorry for the confusion, my link wasn't right: Try this. See also WP:REF and WP:N and WP:NOT. Consensus is clear that these taglines should go.  

Just exactly what do you call a consensus? Two people against one? 

 I call those links consensus. By the way, with WP:NOT I meant WP:UNENC, I should have been more specific.  

 Tag lines List re-added. Dispute of it's removal 

I am returning the Tagline list again. The Taglines from """"The Rocky Horror Picture Show"""" are both culturely significant (Don't Dream It, Be it, and Let's do the Time Warp Again, both used as song lyrics and later as tag lines for the film in Print advertisement are two of the most remembered Tags as well as the original """"A Different Set of Jaws"""") and Quoted in publications such as Time Magazine and Newspaper articles from coast to coast including the Fresno Bee, Sacramento bee and Modesto Bee, the San Francisco Chronicle as well as the New York Times. There is also the book """"The Rocky Horror Picture Show Book"""" by Bill Henkin. That does answer to both Arguements from above. I officialy dispute it's removal. This is an article about a motion picture not about an individual item. There is going to be at least two list in ALL articles about films. The cast and crew and if its a musical a song list. Where advertisement has a significant historical context or influence it is notable to add the list. The call was for a cleanup not just a mass deletion. Plus I recommend both of the above to add citations as I have. I am looking through alot of media and will be adding more.

I would like to now hear from a Wiki Admin on the subject as I believe it is the only way to end the dispute.  

You are confused on an important part of wikipedia policy: admins are not in any real position of authority. Things are decided by consensus and an admin's opinion is worth no more than any users. As I said above, consensus is clearly against you and the inclusion of these taglines.  

I am sorry but you are incorrect about what a consensus is. Please see below to the Wiki definition of Consensus. Also A true consesus takes time. More than you are allowing, per Wikipedia policy.  
 Consensus should not be for or against an individual but about the subject.  

Also, your arguments are clearly wrong. First, the taglines were not used as song lyrics, the song lyrics were used as taglines. Also, the fact that there is a book about the rocky horror show that mentions the taglines does not mean the article should.",0,0,0,0,0,0

We started a proposal Wikipedia:Wikiethics to state the existing policies coherently and make suggestions on improving the editorial standards in Wiki. I thought you might be interested in contributing to that proposal.

Unfortunately, a pro-porn and pro-offense lobby is trying to make this proposal a failure. They unilaterally started an approval poll although almost no one including me believe that it is time for a vote, simply because the policy is not ready. It is not even written completely. 

Editors who thinks that the policy needs to be improved rather than killed by an unfair poll at the beginning of the proposal, started another poll ('Do we really need a poll at this stage?') at the same time. The poll is vandalized for a while but it is stable now. A NO vote on this ('Do we really need a poll now?') poll will strengthen the position of the editors who are willing to improve the ethics policy further.

Which part did you not understand? She did not only  apply for citizenship she only regularized her papers. She could have done it at age 90. She would be Portuguese all the way. In Canada you have  one month to register a child, in Portugal for those born abroad there is no time limit to register. 

I will give you an easy example:  I child born in Canada before being registered is not Canadian? (So , all the children that are born in Canada and die before being registered are foreighners)
  
The problem I have with the consensus version:
1. It is not a consensus, not everybody agrees
2. You were given references
3. Citizenship, as you are aware,it is not the same as nationality. And writing she is Canadian with Portuguese nationality would be misleading too.  
4. She is no more Canadian than she is Portuguese
5. I can only understand your reasons as being xenophobic.If you have any valid reason please state it.

I am putting it here, kindly read the whole story alongwith the proofs.

It appears that Admin User:Abecedare has ended up doing some big injustice without checking the facts. Per he has blocked anon User: 32.177.111.155 simply because he was trying to protect Wikipedia. Please correct this error otherwise this injustice and blocking comments are going to harm both innocent editors ( User: 32.177.111.155 and User: 209.183.55.115  ) and their zeal to work on wikipedia and their future contributions/history as well.

Why User Talk: 32.177.111.155's Block was unjustified

User Talk: 32.177.111.155’s edits do not constitute vandalism

He simply restored duly referenced text. 
 Proof 1
 Proof 2
 Proof 3

 User Talk: 32.177.111.155 did not violate WP:3rr 

He did not violate WP:3RR and he simply quit editing.

 User Talk: 32.177.111.155 can not be a called a sockpuppet

 It was mentioned that User: 209.183.55.115 is licensed to Concord, CA and User: 32.177.111.155 is licensed to Los Angeles. Both of these cities are 6-7 hours of drive from each other? And it usually takes 1.5 hours of flight time if you want to fly from one city to another. 
  against violation of Wikipedia policies. Is simple warning constitute sockpuppetry?
If  had owned 2nd IP 209.183.55.115 as well, then he could have participated in the edit war through 2nd IP while staying within WP:3RR. It means he was not related to the 2nd IP at all.

Why ’s edits constitute violation of Wikipedia policies

Editor  repeatedly deleted duly referenced tex

Edit 1 
edit 2 
Edit 3 

Editor  repeatedly lied

 lied/mislead Wikipedia community through his edit summaries and statements.
Edit 1 – edit summary “Google Books isn't a very reliable source. Find a better source than that..”
edit 2 – edit summary “Reverted 1 edit by 32.177.111.155 identified as vandalism to last revision by Neutralhomer”
Edit 3 – edit summary “Reverted 1 edit by 32.177.111.155 identified as vandalism to last revision by Neutralhomer”
again lied that city of Concord and city of Los Angeles are next to each other to get the opposing editors blocked under sock category.

Editor  repeatedly violated WP:POV 

User:Neutralhomer ruthlessly suppressed others voice and kept on removing the referenced text by blatantly refusing to accept the wp:rs reliability of various internationally known newspapers and a very notable google book which is already part of wikipedia, i.e. Reduced to Ashes (book).

All these MBT's including the Merkava, can fit aboard the C-5 Galaxy and C-17 Globemaster air transports to be airlifted anywhere on the globe. The Merkava Mk 4 has a 1500hp GD833 Diesel Engine and additional armor, especially up top, for urban battlefields. Ever been to the Holy land? You get all types of terrain there, not the stereotypical desert/arabian landscape that is always seen on TV. There are forests and swamps in Israel, and up north the terrain is especially rough and it snows too. What consensus are you talking about? Israel has had more battlefield experience with the use of armor and armored warfare in general than any country on this planet. The weight of the Merkava Mk 4 is approximately the same as the M1A2SEP. It has more crew protection than the Leopard tank and has an active self-defense system. It also retains the 60mm Mortar which can be fired under armor. BATTLEFILED MOBILITY of the Merkava series of tanks is better than both the M1 and the Leopard. It is true that both tanks are faster than the Merkava but the Merkava was designed with emphasis on crew protection, survivability and firepower, over speed. The Merkava is more survivable in a firepower-saturated environment meaning it can go places the M1 and Leopard cannot. For this reason the Merkava has more freedom to maneuver, which gives more options to it's operators and commanders, and allows more aggressive courses of action. The enemy cannot simply deny areas to the Merkavas by firepower, meaning the Israeli tank has better battlefield mobility than the Abrams and Leo 2.",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Fort Apache 

For two years, this reference has been troublesome. Clearly, John Ford wanted to draw a parallel between Col. Thursday and GAC. However, Ford's intent and the extent of the parallel have been distorted in the previous edit. The similarities are vague at best, and film depicts a clear verbal confrontation and  agreement to do battle between the Apaches and the cavalry; Thursday's """"last stand"""" troop consists of about 20 soldiers, not hundreds; the Apaches create a deliberate ambush of the cavalry with no similarity to LBH; the John Wayne character inherits Thursday's mantle (and head gear) and affirms the value and worth of """"the regiment."""" All of this indicates that Ford utilized fragments of the GAC/LBH history to make a very different and pro-military point that the previous edit ignored. Nothing wrong with what Ford was doing in this classic film - but the previous edit stretched itself to great lengths to make parallels to Custer that do not in fact exist. I have reduced the edit to the only clear parallels that actually occur in the film.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Article needs overhaul 
 This pages need serious considerations of revisal.  

An ethnic group means sharing a large element of genetic relation amongst its members. Afghans (Tajiks included) are closer related to Northwest South Asian populations GENETICALLY, than to Iranian populations. 

http://www.zackvision.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/genome_Zack_Full.txt.cleaned_BGA_4.png

Iranians, on the other hand, genetically cluster with South Caucasians, Anatolians, and Mesopotamians. The only relation Tajiks have with Persian Iranians is a shared language and somewhat-shared literary culture. Other than that, the genetics prove that they are not closely related groups.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

 This pages need serious considerations of revisal.  

i agree, this article need serious consideration as soon as possible for revisal

the article is totally misleading. tajiks and afghans should have their own article and like other nations, persians (or iranians) should have an article of their own. perisan is only an ancient name for iranians. please consider correcting the article.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

Exactly, this really is extremely misleading. There already is a """"Persian language"""" page- the ethnicities are distinct.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

 request of an administrator  

Please revert this article, this article is full of errors. iranians and afghans are two different nationalities and ethnicities. they can not be mixed according to wikipedia rules and according to the fact that persian (iranians) and afghans are not the same thing and can not be in the same category. thank you  

 Second Paragraph Should Be Deleted 

""""Afghanis, better known as Afghoonis or Efis and Afaghaneh, are not part of the Persian people and they are acting as wannabe persians, they are not proud of their nation and we Iranians hate them hate them hate them.""""

This should be taken out of the article, for obvious reasons/
  

 afghoonis are not Persians 

afghanis are not persians, austrians speak german but are not germans and they do not consider themselves as germans, they are neither considered germans by the people of germany, the people of switzerland speak french but they are only swiss and it is wrong to call the swiss peoiple as french people. the people of belgium speak dutch, but they are not dutch or netherlanders, the people of brazil speak portuguese but they are not portuguese people. they are brazilians speaking portuguese. the people of ghana speak english but they are not english. and finally the afghans speak a dialect of persian. but they are not persians racially or ethnically or historically. afghans are ethnically and racially a mixed nation. the tajiks, are related to people of central asia, to the people of uzbekistan, turkmenistan and tajikistan. the tajiks of afghanistan look exactly the same as tajik and uzbeks because they are the same. the hazaras are not related to the iranian or persian race, they are of mongol origin, their hazaragi language which is a dialect of dari language, is heavily mixed with the momgolian languiage, their look and appearence attest to the fact that they are only assimilated mongols. even the word hazara is a millitary unit which describe that they were a part of  the mongol chengiz khan army who destroyed civilization of iran including nishabur and tus and many other cities of khorasan. (khorasan is in iran and is iranian, not afghani or afghanistan). 

tajiks are iranized or persianized central asians, like uzbeks are turkified central asian people. tajik is NOT a synonym of persian or iranian, tajik only refered to people of central asia which became iranized,",0,0,0,0,0,0

Seriously, i don't know why i even try. Next you know, all newspapers are """"rags"""" and diplomatic sources such as the Kremlin website are not reliable... Oh wait... We already went to that stage. -  
 As I explained above, the Daily Mail  - a notoriously unreliable English newspaper - 's article is from 20 December and is talking about the earlier controversy about Depardieu saying he was going to renounce French nationality.  It was impossible for this to be true since he did not have any other nationality to fall back on.    

Alledgely claims by Depardieu's Agent

Will the honourable gentleman behind IP 87.67.143.211 post ANY KIND OF SOURCE to back his claim, or will you just continue vandalizing the article and removing content and references? -  

Depardieu is a French actor having his legal residence in Belgium. That's all for the moment

1. France did not remove Depardieu's citizenship yet (otherwise, where is the source?).

2. Depardieu never applied for Russian citizenship.

3. Ask your Prof. of International Law (I did).

4. See here: http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/filmstar-gerard-depardieu-von-putin-zum-russen-ernannt-a-875537.html): “Die Formulierung des Kreml, wonach Depardieu einen Antrag auf Einbürgerung gestellt hatte, wurde von einem Assistenten des Schauspielers dementiert.“

In English: The formulation of the Kremlin, that Depardieu had filed an application for naturalization, was denied by an assistant of the actor.

So yes: the Kremlin lied.

5. Lock this article once and for all for the rest of the month.

6. Ask yourself: If tomorrow, every country of the world offer Depardieu a passport, what do you do? Will you consider he's a Afghanisto-Albanio-Algerio-Andorro-Angolo-Antiguo-Barbudo-Argentino-Armenio-Australio-Austrio-Azerbaijo-Bahamo-Bahro-Banglado-Barbado-Belaro-Belgo-Belizo-Benino-Bhutano-Bolivio-………-Zambio-Zimbabwean actor?

We are allowed to mention researchers' conclusions, and this conclusion by Kinsey is especially relevant to the text. It's also what I just stated above: """"Obviously, women generally know what makes other women feel good sexually, which is what the researchers are saying."""" It is your opinion and a case-by-case basis that """"having orgasms most of the time during sex does not equal sexual satisfaction in a relationship."""" I state that because it's not the same case for everyone. It is also your opinion that lesbians experience less sexual satisfaction in a relationship. The sources you kept removing state the very opposite of what you assert about sexual satisfication in lesbian relationships. And because they do, you've asserted that they are biased and/or unreliable. They are not. Those sources are what most of the research states about sexual satisfaction in lesbian relationships. Most of the sources do not state what Schwartz stated about sexual satisfaction in lesbian relationships. Not even half of reliable sources state that. Her view is a minority view, and it's also an outdated view because of what I've noted already. It hasn't been replicated. New research on lesbian sexuality consistently reports the opposite of Schwartz's assertion about sexual satisfaction in lesbian relationships. And I reiterate that Schwartz was focusing on long-term lesbian relationships, not just on lesbian relationships in general.   

The article is not a comparison article. It mentions a few comparisons to heterosexual sex in the Research section because these comparisons are notable and especially relevant to the topic. This is because researchers have often studied that aspect of lesbian sexuality, to help them better understand it as compared to heterosexual sexual activity. They obviously didn't see that it was needed or especially relevant to compare lesbian sexual satisfaction to gay male sexual satisfaction. And since gay male couples don't include women, I can see why they felt that way. They were comparing how women are sexually satisfied by a different sex/gender. They brought heterosexual couples into it. It wasn't Wikipedia that did that. And we should report on it because they did and made it a big part of studies on lesbian sexuality. Simply listing stats doesn't sufficiently inform readers of this information, unless those stats are as detailed as the text. And you really need to stop citing that discredited Schwartz study as though it is a majority or widely held view among researchers. It isn't. But I agree that it should be included in the article. 

We don't have to list stats for the lines you quoted above. What we have to do is follow the sources. If the sources had stats, then maybe we would include those. But including them also doesn't mean that they would be traded out for the text material. The """"Other elements of lesbian sexual encounters include more full-body sexual contact"""" line is about lesbians only, and it's supported by two reliable sources. I understand that you take objection with that paragraph because it's stating that women in same-sex sexual relationships are more satisfied, sexually and in life in general, but it's what the sources say. Still, it would probably be better to attribute that to the author(s) reporting it. We don't have to present a survey that asked heterosexual women and lesbian women their sexual satisfaction levels. That is covered by the sources, and only material especially relevant to the topic of lesbian sexual practices should be included. And, yeah, you have made claims. And, no, you don't present sources. Not generally. For sources, all you've done is repeatedly note the Schwartz study, no matter how many times I point out to you that it is discredited, and you state that """"many other sources"""" show the opposite of the material you kept removing.

 Since I feel that this is an important topic I have made an effort to update and improve the article, although this is not an area of expertise for me and this has limited what I am able to do. As I see it the purpose of the article should be, as with articles such as Automotive industry in the United Kingdom or Automobile industry in China, to provide a concise overview of the industry including its history, current state and economic impact, important products and companies. 

 I agree that the list of first flights is not appropriate. In my view this should be changed into a prose description of the history of the industry, with some of the first flight details being woven into the text as appropriate.

 I have started trying to improve the 'Major participants' section but in my view this requires more work. The 'Current developments' section contains a lot of interesting and useful information but appears to need some updating. 

On a minor point I see that you have moved Thales from the overseas to the domestic section of the paragraph in the lead on major participants.

There is no country in the wiki which has termed 'Foreign relations and military' together in one heading. Neighboring countries like Japan, China, Pakistan, South Korea, USA, UK etc .... articles has formatted as such (Foreign relations and military - under two different title headings.

Google determines what videos violate copyright on YouTube, and I fail to see why you are in a better position to know than Google is, unless you are the copyright holder. Google removes videos when a valid claim of copyright violation is made, and before that there is no assumption (and certainly no proof) that the video violates copyright.

If you do not have that factual knowledge, please explain why you have the right to act as if it does violate copyright.

 Epalela fish pond

A fish pond, or fishpond, is a controlled pond, artificial lake, or reservoir that is stocked with fish and is used in aquaculture for fish farming, or is used for recreational fishing or for ornamental purposes. In the medieval European era it was typical for monasteries and castles (small, partly self-sufficient communities) to have a fish pond.

History

During the winter, supplying fresh food for a castle garrison was a constant struggle. Although meat would be available from deer parks, this couldn't supply the needs of the whole household. A fish pond provided an elegant solution. As long as there was a natural flow of water into the pond, fish required no feeding and were available all year round. There would usually be a series of ponds, with fish being moved between them as they grew.

7fa8155b9f441d5c,"Nephilim deleted edit 

You state reliable sources. The first part of my edit is that which is taught in college (you would know if you ever attended). It is taught in literature class. It is: When studying this passage, or any passage of the Bible, it is best to use the Exegetical method, which is tearing it down to the bottom and rebuilding it using 6 contexts. First, one must use the Bible to interpret the Bible. Second, using the 6 contexts, which are: 1. What is the context (main idea, or thought) of the Bible?, 2. What is the context of the book you are reading (Genesis, Exodus, etc.)?, 3. What is the context of the chapter you are reading?, 4. What is the context of the verse you are reading? 5. What is the context of the key words?, and 6. What is the historical context? How did the people of that time think, act, etc. An example, to name something is to place one's authority on it. A king of a city state that has conquered another city state gives it a new name, because he is place his authority on it. Two things to keep in mind for a sound, correct interpretation of this passage are: 1. Where is the beginning of the narrative; the pivotal spot? It is Genesis 3:15, which is a prophecy of Christ and the beginning of the battle between evil and good. It is followed by the first example the story of Cain and Abel., 2. In the original Bible there were no chapter or verses, these were added later to make it easier to find passages. The story of the Flood begins at Genesis 4:17 and goes to Genesis 9:7 (this story should have been 1 chapter).
This aids the scholar attempting to understand and interpret a difficult passage. 
The next part: Wilson's Old Testament Word Studies, William Wilson (MacDonald Publishing Co. ISBN 0-917006-27-5, New Wilson's Old Testament Word Studies, William Wilson; Kregel Publications 1987, ISBN 0-8254-4030-0/ both page 185)renders the word nephilim meaning as to fall upon other in rapine violence and apostates fallen from true religion. Strong's Exhaustive Concordance Of The Bible Hebrew and Chaldee Dictionary, James Strong (MacDonald Publishing Co. ISBN 0-917006-01-1) cites the word as a bully,tyrant, or dictator. 
Here is given references to where the data is gotten (even page numbers), but by what you say this is reliable or acceptable. Just what would be.
The next part: One can get copies of the First and Second Book of Enoch, which one can read. Two such books are The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha, Vol 1(Doubleday & Co. Inc., 1983 ISBN 0-385-09630-5)and The Other Bible(Harper & Row, Publishers ISBN 0-06-250031-7)and there others. A WARNING. When reading these books keep in mind that they are non-canonical and are considered fictional; not God inspired and truthful. When one reads the Book of Enoch one sees a measurement for the offspring as 300 cubits. A cubit is 18 inches (check any Bible dictionary), or 1 1/2 feet. As such the offspring is 450 feet tall.
This again shows where one can find the data. All these references are from PUBLISHED and ESTABLISHED books, that is accepted by college professors, but not by you. How did the article get on Wikipedia? Did the author bribe someone, or is it that they are a dear buddy?
You may think this harsh, and it may be, but it is deserved. The reason why the information has been verified with published authentic sources that you refuse to accept. Then what needs to take place is that the articles references must be rejected as well for they are based on the same method and material. Why accept one person's references and not an others when both are from published established sources available to the public.
Once before I attempted this folly on an other article and again nothing, not even a police report, was accepted. The only thing I can think for this is that Wikipedia employees are not getting their palm greased, or that I am not a dear buddy with an in.
The reliable verified referenced attainable data is beneficial and helpful to the reader and scholar, but you and Wikipedia don't care, and spit on me, my effort to help, and the ones who would have benefited from it.

As leaders of the (""""Walk-in Closeted SA Catholic Community,"""")  PEREZ and Lozano agreed to pull out """"the BIG guns"""" and turn this over to """"Dirty Dave"""" (DK) KataCulos (sic,) bassist and illegitimate son of lovely Rosemary Catacolos.

Rosemary Kowalski denies that she has ever had a relationship with, to or in the BIBLICAL SENSE with David, now appearing at NONA's and DELORES DEL RIO under the assumed (i.e.,) """"stage name"""" of """"Jollie Chalie"""" Schoenfeld.

 Most Haunted

Although """"possessed"""" is in inverted commas, I think it would be more accurate to say that he """"appeared to be possessed"""". Acorah was supposedly """"possessed"""" by some """"spirit"""" every week and in fact, he was later dropped from the Most Haunted shows after the team became convinced he was making things up from bits of information he overheard during filming. Thirdly, some of the audience say they see """"dark beings"""" and other such things on the webcams every week - not just in this programme.

Due to the general requirement of the use of some social engineering in this case (and normally in Type 0 vulnerabilities as well), many programmers have disregarded these holes as not terribly important. This misconception is sometimes applied to XSS holes in general (even though this is only one type of XSS) and there is often disagreement in the security community as to the importance of cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.
This section misses the entire point. If I wanted to grab cookies from users using some form of local JavaScript exploit (just an example, there are hundreds of other things possible), I could use a type 1 vulnerability on a forum or popular website in order to attack the maximum number of users. The social engineering side of it is therefore a side-note, as it only applies when an attacker is targeting one specific user - and even then if they know they frequent that site they don't have to social engineer them at all.

Furthermore, what's with the names in the exploit scenarios? I'm all for equality but I'd like to see names in there that are at least somewhat universally pronounceable and single-barrelled. Try something like Anne instead of Lorenzo de Medici. 86.14.89.251",0,0,0,0,0,0

 What I addad 

The below was liked. If someone wants to chop this down and add it, be my guest. ~   

In 2012, the Journal of Palestine Studies was forced to translate and publish a 1937 letter of David Ben-Gurion after the pressure group CAMERA reported an error made in a journal article written by Pappé. In his article, Pappé had written, """"Ben-Gurion, for example, wrote in a letter to his son in 1937, 'The Arabs will have to go, but one needs an opportune moment for making it happen, such as a war, citing pages 167–68 of David Smith's 2004 Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict. After checking Smith's book for the quote, CAMERA noticed that there had been an error in citation, and wrote to JPS saying so: """"the quote attributed to Ben-Gurion does not appear in the citation provided."""" The JPS verified this, but in doing so highlighted something that CAMERA had not:

The JPS, for its part, does not mention that the paperback version of Pappé's book, certainly at least the 2011 reprint, uses (p. 23) the quote with the same mark positioning as the JPS article—""""The Arabs will have to go, but one needs an opportune moment for making it happen, such as a war."""" The paperback provides different sources to the Smith citation used in the journal article, though: """"Ben-Gurion's Diary, 12 July 1937, and in New Judea, August–September 1937, p. 220.""""

Having uncovered these citation errors and discrepancies, the journal decided to go the final step and have the entirety of Ben-Gurion's letter translated into English. The translated letter confirms that, regardless of citation errors, the underlying interpretation of the letter provided by Pappé's article and book was sound. In the letter to his son, Ben-Gurion is quite clear: """"We must expel Arabs and take their place.""""""",0,0,0,0,0,0

The early years of the study of NRMs did include a lot of discussion of what might today be called """"non-religious"""" cults, like therapy cults, which might not be specifically religious, but do perhaps have most if not all of the characteristics of cults. The RfC was closed based on the question of criteria for inclusion, and taking that into account, changing the title or otherwise changing the criteria for inclusion would be the next apparent reasonable step.

Re, your message, Gogo is not responding because he isn't at his computer. He isn't a robot that's on 24/7/365. Your rudeness and impatience seems to know no bounds.

Are you going to give me an apology?  When you wrote that comment (January 3), you suggested that I was being 'impatient'.  But it's now 13 days LATER.  Dodo is being rather scarce, even today.   Your excuse, that Dodo didn't answer because he 'isn't at his computer' is wearing pretty thin, nearly two weeks later.  It looks to me that I was correct:  At the time, Dodo was not responding, but that was NOT because he 'isn't at his computer'.  Rather, he was not responding, because he had been caught doing 'drive-by edits'.   Dodo 'ran away', and he let his minions cover his ass while he ran.  At the time (January 3), you got away with claiming that I was being 'impatient', because it was at least plausible that Dodo wasn't at his computer.  But the validity of such an excuse hasn't stood the test of time.
It's really quite simple:  Wikipedia obviously attracts 'control freaks', 'info-Nazi's', etc.  Such people insinuate themselves into a position of control, as 'Administrators' if possible.  There, they abuse their positions.  Dodo needs to resign, and let some other person do that job.  And you need to stop defending him.",0,0,0,0,0,0

For your knowledge Meru was officilly placed here to watch this talk page by mediator Nicholas Turnbull, and this talking is in the process on entering the arbitation comity, so your interventions here are so outplaced as they can be!
I talked with Nicholas Turnbull tonight who disagree with your actions.
You are not appointed here and do not have to make decisions above the heads of the members of the arbitration comity, so you will be very kind to step aside and anihilate your previous doing.
This is not your playground.
I do not know what are your motives to acting as you do as nobody has ever seen you here, but you do seems to go at it with a revenge.
Any reasons who would be worth mentioning now?
You have just been elected admi and the first thing you do is blocking and banning fox from a site you don't know and that you were not aware of for 24 hours ago.
This don't go, you are overstepping wikis rules and previously made decision about this talkpage.
You are acting very unbalanced and provocating a chaos who wasn't there before and who in fact wasn't there as far as the 22th of september. Isn't your role to make things work? 
Another veru very important thing is that you are walking on my article about a Settlement Proposal, that I do recommend you to read carefully, and that you don't have answer to in your recents edits above, and who therefor have no place what so ever under my article and as a part of it.
So moove your articles above, to follow suite of your childrens fights, and leave the growing up doing the right thing.
This article above was the one I was writng and in fact inserted in Meru own talk page before you made your intrance here, and before the situation degenerated that much.
I did it in an attempt to calm tempers down and create a new tangible goal with better opportunity to solve this dilema than revert war and banishments war.
I was stopped at inserting my article by constant editing of article from people fighting, and had each time to perform some changement of my article before saving it, at the end it was too late, you hade arrived, talk like césar, ban a person wihtout valuable and argued explainations, without warning, and taken over the role assignated to Meru by N. Turnbull a few days ago.

By the time I arrived to save my article about burrying the hachet, heads had already rolled, thanks for you.
For your knowledge, you did it at midnight, a saturday evening, and this kind of action will have required the presence of more users, and an agreement between those.
Your opinion about the presence of Igor or not on his talkpage is none of your business, but the business of the arbitration comity and their decision, not yours.
You will have to be more patient and leave to other the right to decide.
Know your chain of command, and the wikis appointed chain of event before a ban can take place, specialy a definitiv ban!
What about the other guy who begin this reverting phase all together? isn't he guilty as well or is he your personnal friend in the discussion forum?
For if this is the case, and if you do have preferences for who is right and who is wrong, so you shouldn't be here and make interventions as well.
You have to stay neutral, but your judgement sounds arbitrary to me, to the point that even your collegue Meru didn't understood what and why you were doing this and disagreed.
Why are you making troubles, and tell me why the alone person who support your actions, is rjb, the exact person known for insulting peoples very often, reverting all the time, and having started this reverting war completely iognoring previous concensus made about the contain of the biography on this talk page.
He was destroying the work of people, to who it had taken several weeks to obtain.
You didn't baned him, why? Is he your socket puppet, or are you his?
What were you doing 6 hours ago and why did you came here?
Did someone warned you?
What triggered your hush at coming by, first time, so late?
I would very much like to know.

You will please move your dispute and different blowings up on one another on a different place, and will take your bad saturday night mood swing somewhere else than on this talkpage, unless you have a satisfactory explaination for what just did happened.
You can't ban Igor when Holger Beck Nielsen is going to make an intervention on this talk page. I hope you know who this person is.
i do notice that the 2 persons who made reverting a war, and insisted on it are ybm and rjb who are both in very close contact with each other, and in fact I am quiet sure that rjb is The socket puppet of YBM. This way he can do it again and again and",0,0,0,0,0,0

How could it be affirmed that the majority of the public know the names from the Funimation broadcast? Is there any source stating that? Even if that were true, Dragon Ball is known in almost all the English-speaking world, not only in the US. And that's not including the rest of the world. More importantly, the manga is the primary work, and normally the main source for most information regarding a work of fiction it's the printed work, like most American comic-book characters like Superman, Batman, Wolverine, etc.
These are the key phrases to decide what names to use:
WP:ENGLISH
""""Use the most commonly used English version of the name of the subject as the title of the article, as you would find it in verifiable reliable sources (for example other encyclopedias and reference works)."""" I honestly don't think that reliable sources will be found about this topic, at least not like encyclopedias and reference works, which leaves us with the following policy.
WP:MOS-AM
""""Characters should be identified by the names used in the official English releases of the series. If there are multiple English releases, such as both a manga and anime, use the one that is best known and that has contributed most to the work's becoming known in the English-speaking world (usually the primary work)."""" This is the key one. We have to decide which one has contributed more to Dragon Ball becoming known in the English-speaking world. In my opinion, it was the manga, since Dragon Ball has been known for a very long time thanks to it, and, in the US, the first broadcasts of the anime where unsuccessful while the manga was already a success, and I have the impression that it was this success with the manga that lead Funimation to keep on trying. But again, this is not definitive. We need the opinions of people from other English-speaking countries in order to have a more accurate perception.
If we want accuracy, which is also desirable by other Wikipedia policies, we should use the romanizations given by the author (Toriyama) in his Japanese works and then include the alternatives as stated in WP:ENGLISH. After all, most guidelines aren't meant to be a strict rule. But for the moment, first we have to define which one, manga or anime, helped more in making Dragon Ball known in the English-speaking world. And remember, US TV is not the whole English-speaking world. And if we go by the primary work, it's manga.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

60239a2e83c9c376,"Additional information 

I wonder if we could embellish the narrative on this election. There were at least three very important developments in this race.

1. It was the first presidential election in which the national ticket was nominated in conventions. The Anti-Masonic, National Republican, and Democratic Parties held national conventions. 

2. One of the major issues was nullification (the idea that states could 'nullify' or veto congressional legislation). Calhoun refused to run with Jackson for this reason, and South Carolina entered a brief anti-Democratic phase. Calhoun resigned as VP, the first person to do that, and became an anti-administration U.S. Senator. 

3. Another major issue was the National Bank. Clay forced a vote on extending the charter of the Bank in the summer of 1832. Jackson vetoed it. Clay felt that the Bank would be critical to economic development. Jackson did not have a specific policy - Van Buren later created the independent treasury system which laid the groundwork for the banking system which is still in place.",0,0,0,0,0,0

There is a scammer targeting HIV dating sites (as well as other free sites including POF) using Ms. Billards photos and information.  This scammer asks for money, which the patients would otherwise use for their medicines and living expenses.  If you 'meet' somebody purporting to be Ms. Billard on a dating site, please be aware that it is not the real Bobbi Billard.  If you get an e-mail from this person, please reverse-search their headers.  They consistently come back to Nigeria and Ghana.  But please note that it is not *this* Bobbi Billard (sometimes spelled 'Billiard') on the dating site.  The same scammer has been in operation since at least 2005.  

The above information applies to many public figures, but we find the Billard impersonator particularly vile as they ask for tens of thousands of dollars and put the lives of many people in danger.

Imagine what those billions of people are feeling every day not even being able to freaking have their own indivduality and e=not even being able to live here in peace.  No one came here to live the way other people wanted them to, they came here to live THEIR,note the word THEIR, lives.

Nits and Appreciation from Robert Steele

1)  Second ranking civilian:  at the time there were about 25 civilians in Marine Corps intelligence.  The top person was John Guenther, an SES-6 who had been there forever.  I was the second, as a GM-14.  All others were GS-09 to GS-13.  It is an accurate fact.

2)  On the Drug War film, I did not volunteer.  The film producer got in touch with me because of my Amazon reviews, eg. LOST HISTORY on contras, drugs, and CIA, and asked if I could come to Los Angeles for filming.  I agreed provided he would pay my expenses, which he did, and I volunteered my time.

3)  The COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE book is my first book to be published that does not have my name on the cover.  I am turning now toward nurturing and aggregating others and although I have three chapters in this book, recommend it be listed.

If anyone wants to engage in dialog leading to improvements of this page (for example, my three most recent seminal articles on OSINT are at www.oss.net/OSINT-S, www.oss.net/OSINT-O, and at www.oss.net/HILL where my article on """"The Open Source Program: Missing in Action"""" is being read by virtually everyone either planning to attend or deciding not to attend the DNI OSINT conference

I also wrote the Joint Military Intelligence Training Center Open Source Handbook, and the Special Operations Forces Open Source Handbook, as well as the NATO Open Source Handbook, and will create stubs for the first two, should anyone wish to link to them.

I've been told that you're a leading proponent of the theory that the safety of cyclists and pedestrians is best improved by getting people to use these modes of transport instead of their cars.  Like you, I think it's often necessary to force the issue by making driving so unpleasant, frustrating, delay-ridden and unsatisfying that motorists give up and use better forms of transport (no matter how inconvenient they may be).  I agree with you that extremely low speed limits rigidly enforced by camera is the best way of doing this, and I also agree with you that the rise in deaths caused in the short term by these measures is nothing compared to the millions of lives which will be saved when private motoring has been restricted to the most important people (like you and me).  Of course we have to lie and pretend that the measures are there for short-term safety, but it's necessary to do so, and society will thank us in the end.

Your request for rollback

Hi JohnSRoberts99.  After reviewing your request for rollback, I have enabled rollback on your account.  Keep in mind these things when going to use rollback:
Getting rollback is no more momentous than installing Twinkle.
Rollback should be used to revert clear cases of vandalism only, and not good faith edits.
Rollback should never be used to edit war.
If abused, rollback rights can be revoked.
Use common sense.
If you no longer want rollback, contact me and I'll remove it.  Also, for some more information on how to use rollback, see Wikipedia:New admin school/Rollback (even though you're not an admin).

Hello!

The Wikipedia Signpost, a community-newspaper in the English Wikipedia, is covering the Board of Trustees elections and will be featuring each of the candidates in next week's issue. As such, we would appreciate it if you would take some time to answer a few interview questions. Each candidate will be asked the same questions; by no means, though, feel obligated to answer any (or even) all of them, though we would greatly appreciate it if you did.

Some of the questions may be a bit redundant to the candidate information you have filled out already. This is both for convenience and for giving you the opportunity to expand on some of them a bit. However, we ask that you keep all responses brief, limiting them to no more than one or two paragraphs each.

You may leave replies to my English Wikipedia talk page, or on my meta talk page.

As always, the Signpost reserves the right to re-distribute the questions and replies, shorten any responses if necessary, and take any other editorial action deemed appropriate.

It would be good to add Japanese sources to the gaming articles to expand their reception sections because the inclusion of sources from different nationalities helps to reduce systemic bias and POV. Naturally English Wikipedia will use mostly English-language sources, and naturally there are a lot of high-quality English-language RSes, and these are sufficient to demonstrate a game's notability, etc., but high-quality or major non-English and multinational sources would address Wikipedia's second pillar by reducing or eliminating cultural biases in the reporting. It sounds to me like reviews from GAMEST would be a great addition to Wikipedia for this reason.
For articles on games created in non-English-language countries, I think it's also very helpful for a full grasp of the topic to include reception from the originating culture. So in my view, reviews from Japanese sources like Famitsu or GAMEST should be used to expand the articles on Japanese games whenever possible. (And similarly, reviews from French magazines would be helpful for French games, and Russian magazines for Russian games, etc.). I have heard that Famitsu is considered Japan's premier video game magazine so I think that its reviews for Japanese games are particularly helpful, and I have been adding them to gaming articles recently, but thanks for bringing my attention to GAMEST too. If I happen to pick up any copies of it I'll try to add reviews from there as well. Cheers, -",0,0,0,0,0,0

I'ld like to retrieve one small item from the above hidden stuff. Martin's remark """"the answer is 2/3"""" and mine, """"no, the answer is switch"""". I did not mean to imply that the 2/3 should be made completely invisible. Of course one must emphasize that a good *reason* to switch is because the probability is 2/3 that you'll get the car this way. It is even a very very good reason to switch, since it is can be shown (if all doors are initially equally likely to hide the car) that you can't do better; in particular, complicated strategies of sometimes switching sometimes staying depending on specific door numbers lead to a smaller chance of success! (Morgan et al; Gill).

I hoped that this remark of mine would help show that by careful choice of words it's possible to write sentences which many more editors could agree with. And which everyone can agree are not misleading and which everyone can agree reflects what is in the literature.

Remember: Vos Savant and Whitaker ask what the player should do. Introducing probabilities into the story is one way of finding justification for an action. The phrase """"the probability"""" leads straight to controversy, at least to disagreement (both among editors and in the literature). The phrase """"what action should the player take"""" leads to concensus (both among editors and in the literature). 

It's just meant to be a small, practical concensus building suggestion!

I appreciate the computer's catching three syntax errors in the article https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1st_Aerospace_Control_Squadron.  These have been around several years but it is good to know about them.

They occur in the lists of personnel at 1st Aero, their job descriptions (showing now jobs were defined and allocated to different ranks), and the courses offered as training in the development of the squadron's activities for the first formative years.  However, a few days ago, I had occasion to look at the article and saw that, last year, someone had removed all  this detailed personnel information except for the list of Squadron Commanders.  I restored this information recently, but it has again been removed with the comment by BB-PB

grossly excessive level of detail - none of these people are notable

It is a matter of opinion whether, as trackers of man-made satellite, people who have done things that have never before been done in human history are or are not notable.

Is there any way to appeal this decision on the grounds that the listing provides useful historical detail not available elsewhere about the organizational progress of early satellite tracking in the US?  My Ph.D. is in Management Theory so I think this is worthwhile information that should not be suppressed.

I removed the list of Commanders (as that is trivial compared to the other information) and inserted this remark):

""""The historical development of the Squadron is shown by detailed listings of personnel with dates and citations. However, a Wikipedia monitor refuses to allow this level of detail. Copies of the information are available on request from the author.""""
The list of commanders has again been restored, repacing my comment, and I have removed it as they are not notable  it is the workers who did something special.
But the commanders are again restored.

If an appeal is permitted, please tell me how to do that.  seaotter6@aol.com""",0,0,0,0,0,0

anyway:

as SAS ownes the majority stake in arBaltic and a 49% stake in Estonian Air with whome they have a close coopeartion, so it's very likely that these two airlines will go the way that Blue1 already went and join the alliance as Regional Members.

Air One is very close with Lufthansa and fully integrated in Lufthansa's Miles&More; FFP. In fact they are the only fully integrated Airline that is not a Star Alliance member yet. But that seems to be a matter of time.

At the very moment Austrian Airlines ownes a 49% Stake in Slovak Airlines. As the Slovak government is planning to sell off the remaining stake in that airline it is highly likely that Austrian will accquire these stakes. A Star Alliance membership is absolutely possible. 

Silk Air is a fully owned subsidiary of Singapore Airlines. I won't comment on that, as I have never heard of them being a candidate for Alliance membership, but doesn't seem unlikely.

Aegean Airlines and Lufthansa started cooperation last year and according to some statements in the German press both airlines seem to be very interessted in Aegean joining the Alliance.

Luxair has strong ties to Lufthansa and Austrian... might not be joining in the nearest future, but would definitely be welcome in the Alliance

Since you removed Qatar Airways from the list of possible members... It's no secret that Star is really interessterd in Qatar Airways. On the other hand Qatar Airways strengthened their cooperation with Lufthansa, ANA and United last year... they are definitely leaning towards Star Alliance.

They are at least as likely to join Star as TAM or SN Brussles etc. to join OneWorld / Malaysia Airlines to join Skyteam",0,0,0,0,0,0

 God created everything in six days and rested on the seventh  

The article states that """"The text of Genesis relates that God created everything in six days and rested on the seventh.""""  And I agree if you do a casual reading of English translations.  However, some commentaters, notably E. W. Bullinger, argue that the six days describes the creation of the new world after the """"world that was"""".  I have researched and understand Bullinger's argument.  I will present it here.

NIV:

Ge 1:1  In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. 2  Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.

KJV:

 Ge 1:1  In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. 2 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.

Now, the English word """"formless"""" in the NIV and the english words """"without form"""" in the KJV are translations of the Hebrew word tohu, G/K Number H9332 and Strong's Number H8414.  The Strongs Concordance lists one of the meanins of toho as """"to lie waste"""" or simply """"waste.""""  

Likewise, the english word """"empty"""" in the NIV and the english word """"void"""" in the KJV is translated from the Hewbrew bohu, G/K Number H983 and Strong's Number H922.  Strong's Concordance provides one of the definitions of bohu as ruin.

Consequently, it is argued that the verses could be considered something like ~ """"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. 2  Now the earth was waste and ruin, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.""""

Furthermore, Bullinger's observations continue to, and link 2Pe3:6, which states (KJV) 2Pe3:6 """"Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished.""""  Bullinger believes that this is a reference to Ge1:1-2, and not the flood during Noah's time.  He concludes with """"The creation in eternity past, to which all fossils and remains belong.""""  (Companion Bible, page 3).

Consequently, the articles should include, in my opinion, the fact that some theologians reject the young Earth on literal grounds.

See the Bullinger's side notes [].

Also, a quick google search will show that other literal interpreters [] with Bullinger.  

To summarize:  The article should be changed to reflect the fact that some literal interpreters of the Bible do not think the Earth is roughly 6000 years old.   Vacuous Poet""",0,0,0,0,0,0

The time, space, causation, change and eternity articles do include sections on philosophy, but it is embarrassing that the only comment on Asian thought on these matters I found was one sentence in Causality. Consequently, a reader of this article would find little of help in those. Moreover, this article does not discuss the philosophy of time, space, causation, change or eternity in any significant detail. But, I would support linking to those articles once they include significant Asian philosophical content. But, even then, the link should be to the philosophy section, not to the top of the article. I didn't find anything on philosophy or religion in universe or mortality.

What should be linked Major connections with the subject of another article that will help readers to understand the current article more fully:
Vishwanath
Kashi
Shiva
Ishwara
Manisha Panchakam But only if the article is written promptly.
Nrsimha
Kali
Laksmi

The next issue would be to create a template to invoke the module. Obviously it won't be Template:Convert. I could do a user subpage then test with something like {{User Johnuniq:convert|...}}, but that is klunky, and would be unsuitable in an article if I get bold enough to see how it goes in an article with some convert templates.

Actually, now that I look at that last page from the sanctuary again, it doesn't actually say that the owl in the picture identified as the Southern variety is Popo-chan, I just jumped to that conclusion. What's more, looking at the google translated version of the main page, near the top there's a section that says """"Here are the highlights"""", and one line in that section is translated by google (a better translation would be helpful) as """"intimidation, famous in Japan in the mimicry Owl Giant African Scops of Popo Chan"""". The link for """"Giant African Scops"""" gives the scientific name as Ptilopsis leucotis which refers to the Northern White-faced Owl, not the Southern, and since this link is right next to the link for Popo-chan, I assume that link must be intended to tell readers what kind of owl Popo-chan is. So, I think I'll have to move this info back to the Northern White-faced Owl after all.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Tyrannosaurus FA 

Hi Sandy, I was wondering if you would have a quick look at the Tyrannosaurus article and see if it looks to you to meet current FA standards?  I am wondering whether to initiate a discussion on it with a view towards it needing an FA review as the text to me seems repetitive, handling of units hap-hazard and inconsistent, significant overlinking, and needing some reorganisation.  I would welcome any thoughts you may have, and to be clear I am not asking that you take on the job, I just seek the view of an experienced FA contributor.  Thanks.    
 Hi, EdChem ... I'm sorry I have been of so little use in responding to your requests for help lately !

(Will respond to Tony's DYK issue as soon as I can I'm more concerned about sourcing, padding, and copyvio issues than how interesting hooks are at DYK I think interesting hooks might be a concern if the basic pillars of Wikipedia were being met, and I'm concerned that DYK is still a place where not even basic pillars that apply to all articles are upheld.)   When I was new to Wikipedia, dinosaur articles were all the rage; as often happens, it seems that many of the editors who maintained those articles have moved on.  At a quick glance, I can see numerous problems (as you outlined, including uncited text) with the article, but those problems aren't as bad as many older FAs that typically appear at WP:FAR.  It's not surprising that a high-profile topic like tyrannosaurus would deteriorate after its principle editors move on. Instructions at FAR ask that editors post to the talk page before initiating a review, in hopes that some interested editor will improve the article and remove the need for FAR.  You cannot go wrong by listing some of the obvious issues on talk to see if anyone will surface to work on the article.  If no one surfaces in say a month, I agree that the article probably needs to go to FAR.  But there are so many FAs in so much worse shape ... I digress )  Best,  (Talk)

Title reign tables, etc
I made tables for the Title reign part, hope that's okay.
 21:17, 23 Mar 2004 (UTC)

As the author of the Title History section, I think that the tables are horrible.   I didn't make it that way because it's ugly for anyone that has low screen resolutions.  They are also harder to read in my opinion.  At least, with my presentation of the information, they were easy and straight forward to read.
 02:10, 28 Mar 2004 (UTC)

Finally created an account here, I'm the one who made the tables. Well, I think that my version of the Title History looks better and is better to read. But maybe I'm the only one who thinks that way? I'd like to hear other opinions.
I changed the look of the tables a bit, do they look okay?

I have made two versions of the """"Title History"""" tables now. You can see the other one at Stone Cold Steve Austin. I think the table in Austins article is a bit long. The table in Benoits article might be unfriendly for users with lower resolutions. What do you think which table should be used for the Title Histories for the wrestlers?  12:54, 20 Apr 2004 (UTC)

Do you really need a mini-paragraph for every PPV title event Benoit has?  I mean, in a year, is anyone going to care that Benoit had a US title match against Orlando Jordan at the Great American Bash?

Having a detailed account of every Benoit appearance on SmackDown! is not only tedious, it's unnecessary. -  

Regarding Benoit having """"Super Tombstone Piledriver"""" as a Benoit does regularly, um, no. At one time, a very long time ago, he was doing piledrivers as part of his moveset, but he hasn't done a piledriver, super or otherwise, in many years, dating even well before the ban on dangerous moves in WWE. At this point, anyone who even knows that Benoit did a piledriver at one time should be rewarded for their knowledge of very miniscule trivia. I'm removing it. Someone can consider adding it in as trivia if they like.  

Quotes I WILL MAKE YOU TAP OUT come on he says that!   err

I think Benoit does actually have the record for the longest time in the Royal Rumble. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Rumble#Royal_Rumble_Records  ToneLa

IMO, the Personal Life section needs a little bit of an overhaul.  There's the background as to what led to him and Nancy having an affair (Kevin Sullivan told them to travel and appear in public together to maintain kayfabe, to the point of having Nancy grope Chris in bars) leading to the various """"Kevin Sullivan booked his own divorce"""" comments over the years, Nancy changing her name legally to Nancy Benoit (I'm 99% sure of this, as Dave Meltzer, who's friends with Benoit, exclusive refers to her as """"Nancy Benoit""""), and I'm pretty sure he and Nancy had a second child together.   

At the end of the World Wrestling Entertainment section (where it discusses Benoit's neck injury) it states Chris injured his neck in a match with X-Pac. However, I remember reading a quote by Benoit himself where he stated that he actually injured it in a match with Austin (while taking a stunner) and the superplex in the Triple Threat at KoTR simply injured him further. Can anyone verify this?

 Disturbing trend to whitewash history 
I have noticed that some contributors to this article seem to be desperate to wash over the parallels between Islam and Islamist terrorism. You need not look further than the term """"Islamist terrorism"""" itself, which is improper grammar in English. I believe that the term is preferred to """"Islamic terrorism"""" because the latter seems, in their minds, to connote that terrorism is sanctioned in the religion. I personally despise this kind of thinking because it assumes that the reader is a moron who cannot discover the truth. I have seen this kind of handling of controversial subjects in other articles. I have even seen attempts to delete articles of that type from Wikipedia. I should probably note here that I am a liberal with no agenda here other than to comment. I just hate seeing this kind of desperate attempt to conceal the truth. Deal with the subject head-on and do not shy away from the harsh reality. -  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Hi,

Can you explain on its talk page why you protected this article?

There is some edit warring going on, but not very heavy (for the standards of this article). Also I am a participant in a mediation case, but that concerns actually only the use of one source on this page, and is irrelevant to the present edit warring.

Likewise, Catt's """"electromagnetism"""" does not pass muster. """"Displacement Current (and how to get rid of it)"""" throws up quite enough problems. Reading it critically reveals that although the article makes assertions about displacement current, the only """"real science"""" is does is to model the voltage at the source end of a transmission line as it is charged through a resistor. Since """"displacement current"""" is the prediction that a changing electric field causes a magnetic field, the only way to disprove the concept is to disprove the existence of the effect. Catt et al didn't even try to do this.

For example the reference you put are biased on one openion and in one direction that is Anti Ahmadiyya websites. How can some one claim that the material which is published on Ahmaiyya site is edited..even if it is edited to suit something, we must accept it as an Official point of view of a community, we dont have to agree with it, but we have to accept it as Official point of view. So if you put some information from an Anti Ahmadiyya web site it will be biased as on the official web site you dont find this information, the best informaiton will be if we can match this information on both sides, other wise, regardless true or false, it will remain Biased and that is against the Policy of Wikipedia. That is why i have suggested earlier that there is no restriction on puting information on open plate form like Wikipedia, but instead of puting on this artical there are other artical where this information can be put it. For example, there are Artical like Islam and Quran, but Critism on Islam is a totally different Artical, so the Islam Poisition is defined in Islam Artical, but Critism was defined in other Artical. If a Bio Artical like Mirza Ghulam Ahmad is a Bio Artical, the Critism or his so called failed Prophecies, will not suit for this Artical. You can even creat a new Artical more suitable to the title and information against him or his Community.

Whether or not it has anything to do with homeopathy doesn't change the marvel of what this first look into this new type of data holds as it is very interesting.  I chuckle to see the anonymous """"layperson"""" editors immediately discrediting nobel prize winners research because they must be a quack.  You are writing in wikipedia.

OldLady Productions then went up to a cast of 5 people. About a year later OldLady Productions fired to of their members ( Daniel and Steven ) and got to new actors ( Marino and Gianni ).
Their most viewed video on youtube was their """" Camp Rock Parody """" video with over 125 000 views after 3 months that it was uploaded. This was a big break for them because 
they never imagined getting anywhere close to that amount of views. Although in reality it is not that many views, for a new video company it was fantastic.

- Music Battle 2008
- Never Back Down ( training video ) * Parody *
- Chriss Angel
- James Bond

These movies were done for amusement purposes, before OldLady Productions commenced their actual company videos. OldLady productions is planning to create and unveil new and improved movies, starting with * Soccer Battle 3 * You may only be able to see all these videos on the official OldLady productions website. Most of these videos will not be on youtube because they are starting their big outbreak with Soccer Battle 3.

Representatives of Hinduism held a variety of views on Muhammad, some with an assertion that the prophet was none else than the Narashansrishi of the Vedas, predicted in the Atharva Veda.[183] One of the prominent Vaishnava proponents, A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada maintained that Mohammad and Jesus, were empowered representatives of God, saktiavesa avataras.[184] In a variety of other points of view, some translated the phrase """"the last prophet"""", suggesting that Vedic deity Agni is none other but Muhammad.[185] In 1926 Siddiq Hussain's two-volume Kannada book, Ja at Guru Sarwar-i 'Alam, argued that the Muhammad was actually Kalki avatar whose arrival had been predicted in the Hindu scriptures, however this view is not a widely accepted doctrine.[186] On the other hand Mirza Ghulani Ahmad argued that Rama and Krishna were prophets of God who had foretold the arrival of Muhammad as God's last law-bearing prophet.[187] Mohammad is sometimes linked to the passage of the Rig Veda declaring that Narashams rishi will arrive as the """"last divine messenger"""" (antim deva duta), who shall """"dispel all darkness"""" and """"conquer death"""".[188]""",0,0,0,0,0,0

The first Tudor King, Henry VII, came to the throne by winning the Battle of Bosworth in 1485, which was Tudor vs. York. The next year he married Elizabeth of York which helped legitimise his claim to the throne; but any tensions in the next few years were Tudor vs. York, not Tudor and York vs. """"Plantagenet assemblies.""""
Research: I read the articles Plantagenet, Tudor dynasty, Battle of Bosworth, Henry VII of England, Elizabeth of York, checked the links  and a few on-line sources about Norton Canes, and off-line checked A.R.Myers, England in the Late Middle Ages, p.185, which lists risings and disturbances from 1486 to 1497 but does not mention this, and C. Ransome, A Short History of England, p.173, ditto.

Leejc is absolutely right. He did a better job expressing what I tried to say back in June, 2007. But while I agree with his final conclusion, it isn't quite the right argument to use, that """"we must assume the worst,"""" to get it. So I thought I would try once again to explain how the different wordings of this problem, that seem to say the same thing, can lead to different solutions.

The ultimate cause of confusion is the math-specific definition of the term """"event."""" When a random experiment produces a result, that result is not called an """"event,"""" it is an """"occurrence."""" """"Event"""" is defined to be the subset of all possible occurrences that have some defining common property. So if I flip a coin a hundred times, there are only two possible events: """"heads"""" and """"tails."""" There will most likely be about fifty occurrences of each event; and each occurrence will fit into only one event.

If I draw a card from a standard deck of playing cards, there are lots of possible events and/or occurrences. Some of them overlap. They include """"black card,"""" """"spade,"""" """"honor card (TJQKA),"""" """"Ace,"""" and """"Ace of Spades."""" The occurrence """"black card"""" can be in the event """"spade"""" or """"club"""" as well. Note that an occurrence can fit into other events, but not vice versa. An occurrence of """"spade"""" is also an occurrence of """"black card,"""" but the event """"spade"""" is most definitely not the event """"black card."""" Since determining probabilities involves counting the number of elements in events, the difference can be crucial when less specific observations are applied.

There is a famous problem that isolates this difference between an occurrence and an event. It is called Bertrand's Box Paradox Suppose you have three indistinguishable boxes, each with two indistinguishable drawers. Inside each drawer is a coin. Box #1 has two gold coins, Box #2 has two bronze coins (I can't resist the temptation to use the initials B and G), and Box #3 has one of each. You pick a box at random, and open a drawer at random. If the coin is gold, what are the odds that the coin in the box's other drawer is also gold (i.e., that it is Box #1)?

The first issue here, common to story problems, is that this problem describes an occurrence, not an event. We must extrapolate what the possible outcomes of the actions are, to define the event (the set of possible occurrences) that defines the conditional probability.

The incorrect approach to Bertrand's Box Paradox is to say that you narrowed the identity of the box to two possibilities, Box #1 and Box #3. That the """"event"""" matches the observation """"the box has at least one gold coin."""" This is wrong because there are other ways to describe occurrences in that event. If you pick box #3, then no matter which drawer you open, the occurrence is in the event """"the box has at least one gold coin.""""

The correct approach is to define the event as the set of all possible occurrences where you open a drawer with a gold coin. Every possible occurrence that is consistent with the problem description is in this event (remember, it's a set), and every possible element of this event is consistent with the problem description. Both of those conditions have to be true for the event set we extrapolate as the condition. This set has three elements, not two. In two of those three possible occurrences, the box's other coin is gold. The correct answer is 2/3.

I have seen a variation of Bertrand's Box Paradox used to represent the Boy or Girl Paradox. You are the organizer of a neighborhood swim meet. During the meet, you get a phone call from Mr. Smith, who is delayed and can't pick up his children after the meet. He says """"Tell my two kids to go home with a neighbor. Their names are Sarah and..."""" and the phone connection goes dead. There are four families of two children in the meet, and they conveniently include the four possibilities BB, BG, GB, and GG. What are the odds that Mr. Smith has two daughters?

This occurrence can be described as """"a two-child family includes at least one girl."""" But not the event you need to use as the condition. Mr. Smith could have mentioned a boy's name first; and if that boy had a sister, that occurrence would have been an element of the set """"a two-child family includes at least one girl."""" So that event fails one of the two criteria. You get the answer 1/3 by erroneously using this event.

The correct event is just that Mr. Smith mentioned that he had a daughter, and compares to """"you opened a drawer with a gold coin"""" in the Box Paradox. You can count four possible occurrences of that event. In two of those four, representing a single family, Sarah has a sister. The correct answer is 2/4, or 1/2.

If a conditional probability question describes an occurrence, and not an event, care needs to be taken whe",0,0,0,0,0,0

 BLACK DAHLIA MURDER IS NOT 'MELODIC DEATH METAL'!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THEY ARE DEATHCORE PUSSIES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

Black Dahlia Murder IS NOT Melodic Death Metal. They are the farthest band from that genre. Black Dahlia Murder are pieces of shit scene bitches that are trying to be """"METAL"""" along with all of the other Deathcore/Grindcore bands like Job For A Cowboy, Suicide Silence, etc. Fuck all of them! They aren't true Metal and they never will be, they need to stick to what they know...American Eagle, MTV, and all of their other lame trends. Melodic Death Metal is Scar Symmetry, In Flames, Sonic Syndicate, and Disarmonia Mundi. Melodic Death Metal is REAL music, it's not a disgrace to music like Deathcore and Grindcore.

I will continue to change Black Dahlia CUNT'Murder's genre to Deathcore/Grindcore, I don't give a shit..I'm not letting you stupid scene bitches take away the only thing that you and the Mainstream hasn't destroyed and that's the amazing genre of Melodic Death Metal. So fuck all of you trendy conformists, go fucking die.

Black Dahlia Murder are Deathcore pussies that need to be beheaded, them and all of the other Deathcore bands that are ruining Metal.

Deathcore is the biggest piece of shit I've ever heard...it shouldn't even be considered music, it's a bunch of pussy scene kids trying to be """"METAL"""". Deathcore and Grindcore are the two worst forms of music ever invented.

So yeah, you can listen to Deathcore if you enjoy hearing """"music"""" that has no tempo or beat to it whatsoever, they pretty much just hit random shit on the drums and play random notes on the Guitar while the vocalist does terrible random screaming and pig squels. Don't forget the hillarious millions of breakdowns they put into their songs.

""""DA...THIS SONG IS CALLED BIG FUCKING TREE!""""

""""Ya boi....we are so down wit American Eagle..ya boi, my hair does that flippy thing.. RAWR RAWR RAWR I'M SO LYK HARDCORES OMGZ@!!!@@!!!! GAGES AND SNAKE BITES RAWWWRRR""""

Fuck Job for a Cowboy and Black Dahlia Murder, trendy pieces of shit.

Melodic Death Metal owns all. 

There really isn't much of a difference between any """"Deathcore"""" band for that matter, they are all just a bunch of pussies that are trying to fit in with this new trend of trying to be a """"Metal"""" band.

So please don't try to tell me """"OH...YOUR STUPID...THE BANDS AREN'T THE SAME.""""

Ok, so maybe....JUST MAYBE.. Job For A Cowboy's vocalist does 3 more pig squels in a second than the vocalist from Black Dahlia Murder, there I said it! I guess they aren't all the same!!!! Oh dear fuck ..... And my bad...my bad, White Chapel actually does 200 breakdowns in a minute rather than Suicide Silence's 100 breakdowns in a minute. My bad dude you were right all along!! Deathcore and Grindcore bands aren't all the same!!!!!!!!!

But seriously, the genre is pure shit and is just another trend in the music industry that bands are following to """"make it to the top"""" and to fit in with the rest of the bands these days.

I mean, I have nothing against every band in a certain genre sounding the same or anything, but when the """"music"""" of the genre they produce is pure shit and can be done by any living human being on Earth...then I have to draw the line. It doesn't take much talent to do shittty raw screaming, hit random notes on a guitar, and hit your double bass pedal at like 500bpm.

Another reason why I don't take any bands from this genre seriously is their hillarious excuses for a """"band logo"""".

They try oh so hard to be """"HARDDCOREEEEE"""".

I also find it funny that all of these pussy bands have names like, """"ANAL CUNT"""" or """"DEAD DEATH BLOODY DEAD HAND"""".

Fact is, any band that produces """"music"""" under this genre sucks and is just trying to fit-in.

YA BOI! LETS HARDCORE DANCE! RAHHHH YAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Grindcore and Deathcore isn't Metal so all you douchebags should just give up....you aren't Metal and you never will be, go fall into a pool of AID's. 

Fuck Black Dahlia Murder, I'm not giving up....this is insane, I'm not letting you mother fuckers take away the one thing I have that you haven't ruined.""",1,0,1,0,1,0
